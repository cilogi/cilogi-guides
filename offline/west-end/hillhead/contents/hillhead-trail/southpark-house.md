# Southpark House

![Southpark House](southpark-house.jpg)

Southpark House was built around 1850 as a double villa.

It was inhabited by Willian Govan and his sons.  They were Muslin
manufacturers with a factory in Pollockshaws and an office in Renfield
Street central Glasgow.

The house was bought early in the 20th Century by Glasgow University
and used to accommodate women students.

It currently houses the University's media services unit.
