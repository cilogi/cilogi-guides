![Hillhead High School](hillhead-high-school.jpg)

Built between 1928-31 by E. G. Wylie (1885-1954), after his design won
a competition in 1921.  Made of red brick and laid out like a
butterfly. It was built with its corridors open to the elements.

Wylie gave up his practice during the first World War, where he won
the MC and bar. He was responsible for the Glasgow Dental Hospital
among other buildings.  His work was mainly commercial with some
private houses.
