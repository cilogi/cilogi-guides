# Hillhead Underground Station

![Alasdair Gray Mural in Hillhead Station](hillhead-mural.jpg)

Hillhead Underground was opened in 1896 as part of the Glasgow
Subway.  The subway is the third oldest in the world after the London
Underground and the Budapest Metro.

The Glasgow Subway isn't the oldest in Glasgow.  That was the Glasgow
City and District Railway opened in 1886, now part of the suburban
rail network.

Hillhead station was modernised in 2012.  Part of the modernization
includes a mural by Alasdair Gray in the Foyer.
