![Salon Cinema](image:salon-cinema.jpg)

The Salon cinema was originally Hillhead's _Proposed Electric Cinema_.
Its architects were Brand and Lithgow.

The cinema opened in October 1913 with seating for 630 people in the
stalls and a further 133 in the balcony.

the cinema houses a full orchestra and served tea and biscuits to its
patrons.  The original price of entry was 6d for the front stalls, 9d
for the rear and 1s for the balcony.

The Salon closed on the 12 October 1992.  It was very sudden.  The
staff were locked out.  There was a publoc campaign to re-open it but
it was derelict until re-opening as Littlejohn's restaurant in 1999.

In 2008 Historic Scotland listed the building as Categroy A.
