![Botanic Gardens Garage](botanics-garage.jpg)

The Botanic Gardens Garage is the oldest motor garage surviving in
Glasgow, and possibly in the UK. Built in Vinicombe Street from 1906 -
1912, it was designed by David Valentine Wyllie (1857-1930), and has a
distinctive fa√ßade of green and white glazed terracotta tiles. In
December 2007 Historic Scotland classified it as a Category A listed
building.

It was, in effect, Britain's first multi-storey car-park.  At the time
it was illegal to park cars on the street.  Its existence shows how
rich Glasgow was at the time, since the motor car was a very rare and
expensive beast in 1912.

David Wyllie was a Glasgow architect.  He built mainly commercial
building and private homes from 1880. The Garage is his last major
work. He also design 16-17 Lilybank Gardens, which is nearby and owned
by Glasgow University.
