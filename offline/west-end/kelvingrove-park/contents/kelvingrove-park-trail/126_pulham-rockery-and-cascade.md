# The Pulham Rockery and Cascade

Originally build for the [1901 Exhibition][1] by
[James Pulham and Son][2].  It is currenly impractical to supplu main
water for the cascade so at present it functions solely as a rockery..

Pulham were the leading 19th and early 20th centrury makers of
rockworks.  There are only 3 samples of their work in Scotland -- this
on, Ross Hall Park and Gardens, and Ardross Castle Ross-shire.
