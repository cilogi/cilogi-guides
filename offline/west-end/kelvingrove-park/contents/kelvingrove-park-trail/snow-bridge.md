# Snow Bridge

The Snow Bridge, built around 1800 as part of the new turnpike from
Glasgow to Yoker, is probably the oldest surviving river crossing
downstream from the Kelvin Aqueduct at Maryhill. Constructed in local
cream sandstone (now ivy-clad), this simple structure has three arches
over the river and another, smaller arch over the old Bunhouse Mill
lade. It has long been known as the Snow Bridge due to its central
gates in the parapet railings that enabled cleansing carts to dump
snow into the river after heavy storms. Due to the tight curves of the
approaches off Dumbarton Road, the bridge was deemed unsuitable for
the new tram network implemented in the 1870s. Thus it was soon
superseded by Partick Bridge (built in 1878) and relegated to
pedestrian use within the new Kelvingrove Park.
