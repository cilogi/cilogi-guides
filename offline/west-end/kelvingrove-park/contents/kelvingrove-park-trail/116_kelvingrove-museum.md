The construction of Kelvingrove was partly financed by the proceeds of
the 1888 International Exhibition held in Kelvingrove Park. The
gallery was designed by Sir John W. Simpson and E.J. Milner Allen and
opened in 1901, as the Palace of Fine Arts for the Glasgow
International Exhibition of that year.

It is built in a Spanish Baroque style, follows the Glaswegian
tradition of using Locharbriggs red sandstone, and includes an entire
program of architectural sculpture by George Frampton, William
Shirreffs,[7] Francis Derwent Wood and other sculptors. The
centrepiece of the central hall is a massive Pipe Organ installed by
Lewis & Co.

The entrance to the Museum faces the River Kelvin and Kelvingrove
Park.
