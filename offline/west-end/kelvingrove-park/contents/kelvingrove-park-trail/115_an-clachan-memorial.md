# An Clachan Memorial

![An Clachan](an-clachan.jpg)

Perhaps the simplest and most unusual monument in Kelvingrove Park is
the inscribed boulder commemorating _An Clachan_, one of the most
popular displays from the 1911 Scottish National Exhibition. The
three-acre Highland Village alongside the Kelvin was filled with
blackhouses and but-and-ben cottages (complete with peat-burning
fires) and was populated by Gaelic-speaking pipers and
cotton-spinners, all assembled to depict the primitive, yet still
extant, traditions of Highland life. Like the rest of the Exhibition,
the structures of An Clachan were merely lath and plaster and thus
were not intended to survive beyond the end of the season. Today, the
memorial boulder is the sole relic of Kelvingrove's last Great
Exhibition.
