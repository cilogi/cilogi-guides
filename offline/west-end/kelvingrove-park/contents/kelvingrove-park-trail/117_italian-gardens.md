# The Italian Gardens

![Italian Garden](italian-garden.jpg)

The Italian gardens were created 1915-16 as an example of the Italian
style of formal garden.  The design was limited due to limited funds
during the First World War.

The Gardens recently underwent a restoration.  They feature curved red
sandstone walls and masonry steps leading to the cobbles at the rear
of the Museum.
