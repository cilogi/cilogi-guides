The River Kelvin used to be a key part of Glasgow's economy.  The
Bunhouse/Regent's Mill, known at the _Bishop's Mills of Partick_ have
been here since 1450 and closed in 1900.  The Lade (millrace to the
English) supplied water to the mill.  The Lade is on the Museum side
of the river, and runs under the final span of the
