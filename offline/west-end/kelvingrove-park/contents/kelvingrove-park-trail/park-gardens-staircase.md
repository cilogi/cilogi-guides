# Park Gardens Staircase

Architect Charles Wilson's grand entrance to his Park Circus
development was originally planned for the westerly Park Gate entrance
to Kelvingrove, as part of an axial route leading down to a proposed
new bridge over the river. For some unknown reason, in Wilson's
revised scheme of 1855 the staircase was relocated to a less prominent
site at Park Gardens. Constructed of grey Bonawe granite from Argyll,
Wilson's imposing staircase and balustrades are reputed to have cost a
staggering Â£10,000. Unfortunately, this exorbitant sum forced the
omission of planned statues on the main piers.
