# Lord Lister Monument

Seated alongside Lord Kelvin is a bronze monument to Lord Lister, the
Essex-born surgeon and professor whose research into antiseptic
systems revolutionised medicine around the world. In his attempts to
prevent bacterial infections during surgery, Lister's work showed that
carbolic acid (a derivative of benzene) could adequately disinfect
tools and instruments. Although ridiculed at first, eventually his
ideas caught on and soon mortality rates in hospitals dropped by fifty
percent. Lister was primarily based in Edinburgh and London during his
long career, but it was during his tenure as Professor of Surgery at
the University of Glasgow during the 1860s that he undertook his first
experiments with carbolic acid. When the idea of a memorial to Lister
was first mooted after his death in 1912, there were suggestions that
a museum displaying his old equipment in the Royal Infirmary might be
a fitting tribute. The outbreak of war and the subsequent lack of
support from the Infirmary managers led to a revised proposal of a
simple statue, to be cast in bronze by Scots sculptor George Henry
Paulin. The representation of a vibrant Lister, seated atop a grey
granite pedestal, was finally unveiled in September 1924.
