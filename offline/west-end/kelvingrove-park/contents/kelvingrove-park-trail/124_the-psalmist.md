![The Psalmist by Benno Schotz](the-psalmist.jpg)

This is a 1972 sculpture by [Benno Schotz][1] which was commissioned by
the Glasgow Tree Lovers Society and Glasgow Art Gallery and Museums
Association.

The work forms part of the memorial garden to [Tom Honeyman][2] who
was Director of the Kelvingrove Gallery from 1939.  Among many
achievements he was responsible for the purchase of Dali's
[Christ of St. John of the Cross][3]

There are other works (mainly portraiture) by Schotz in Kelvingrove
Museum.  Public works in Glasgow include: the figures of Painting and
Sculpture on the Mercat Building, Glasgow Cross (1928-9); the
sculpture on the Bank of Scotland, 235 Sauchiehall Street (1929-31)
and on the Stenhouse Building, 145 St Vincent Street (1931-2).
