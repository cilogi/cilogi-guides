# Lord Kelvin Monument

![Lord Kelvin Monument](lord-kelvin-monument.jpg)

Lord Kelvin -- Sir William Thompson, 1st Baron Kelvin of Largs --
lived between 1824 and 1907. He was born in Belfast and was a
mathematical physicist.

At the University of Glasgow he did important work in the mathematical
analysis of electricity and formulation of the first and second laws
of thermodynamics, and did much to unify the emerging discipline of
physics as we know it today.

Absolute temperatures are stated in units of Kelvin in his
honour. While the existence of a lower limit to temperature (absolute
zero) was known prior to his work, Lord Kelvin is known for
determining its correct value as approximately −273.15 degree Celsius
or −459.67 degree Fahrenheit.

He also had a career as an electric telegraph engineer and inventor,
which propelled him into the public eye and ensured his wealth, fame
and honour. For his work on the transatlantic telegraph project he was
knighted by Queen Victoria, becoming Sir William Thomson.

He was ennobled in 1892 in recognition of his achievements in
thermodynamics, and of his opposition to Irish Home Rule,
becoming Baron Kelvin, of Largs in the County of Ayr. He was the first
British scientist to be elevated to the House of Lords.
