# Lord Kelvin Monument

Dedicated to Sir William Thomson, Baron Kelvin of Largs, perhaps the
most celebrated scientist and academic of his generation, this bronze
monument was undertaken by Archibald Macfarlane Shannan shortly after
the great man's death in 1908. William Thomson moved from his native
Belfast when his father became Professor of Mathematics at the
University of Glasgow. He himself enrolled in the university at age
ten, became Professor of Natural Philosophy (now Physics) at 22, and
was knighted for his achievements at 44. In a career lasting more than
fifty years, the prolific Lord Kelvin not only developed important
thermodynamic and electrodynamic theories, but also applied his
inventive mind to practical inventions such as the design of a marine
compass and other instruments, the development of the first
transatlantic cable and early applications of electricity. Lord Kelvin
held more than fifty patents, published widely, and received a raft of
awards and honours, though is perhaps best remembered for determining
the temperature of Absolute Zero, now known as the Kelvin Scale. He
was buried in Westminster Abbey (between Newton and Darwin!).
