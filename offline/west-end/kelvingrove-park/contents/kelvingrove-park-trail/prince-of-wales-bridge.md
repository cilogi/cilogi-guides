# Prince of Wales Bridge

In 1868, a timber bridge, painted to resemble stone, was constructed
on this site by City Architect James Carrick to carry the future King
Edward VIII and his Royal Procession over the Kelvin on the way to lay
the foundation stone of the new University buildings on
Gilmorehill. This original, temporary, bridge survived for a quarter
century until it was replaced by the splendid red sandstone and
granite crossing of 1894-95. Designed by City Engineer Alex B
McDonald, the new _Prince of Wales Bridge_ has a single elliptical
arch spanning 12 metres over the Kelvin flanked by the city's coat of
arms carved in the spandrels. Atop the Peterhead granite balustrades
are the remnants of elaborate cast iron lamp brackets.
