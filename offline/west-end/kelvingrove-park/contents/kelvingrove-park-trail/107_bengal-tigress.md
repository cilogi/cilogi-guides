# Bengal Tigress

![Bengal Tigress](bengal-tigress.jpg)

This was the first statue in Kelvingrove Park.  It was created by
[Auguste Nicolas Cain][1] (1822-94) after a drawing by
[Rosa Bonheur][2].  This is his only sculpture in Glasgow.

The statue was presented to Glasgow by John S. Kennedy, a Glaswegian
who emigrated to America and made his fortune. He saw a copy of Cain's
work in Paris in 1867 and bought a copy for Glasgow. There are 4
copies altogether: one in Paris, one in Glasgow, two in the US.
