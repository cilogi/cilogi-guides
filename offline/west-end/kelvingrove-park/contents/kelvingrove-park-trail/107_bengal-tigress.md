# Bengal Tigress

![Bengal Tigress](bengal-tigress.jpg)

It is interesting to note that this work, the first statue installed
in Kelvingrove Park, is not unique to Glasgow. Auguste-Nicolas Cain's
_Bengal Tigress_ (also known as _Tigress and Cubs_, _Tigress and
Peacock_ and the _Kennedy Monument_), which stands atop a red granite
pedestal designed by John Mossman, was unveiled in the park in 1867,
the same year in which a copy was donated to Central Park in New York
City. Kelvingrove's version was the gift of a son of Glasgow, John
Stewart Kennedy, who had immigrated to New York and made his
fortune. Whilst on a visit to Paris in 1866, Kennedy visited Cain's
studio and was so impressed by this work in progress (for the 1867
Paris Exhibition) that he ordered a copy for his native city and
donated it to the Corporation. It is possible that Kennedy was one of
the so-called _other citizens_ who, along with the lead benefactor,
famed telegraph inventor Samuel Morse, jointly sponsored the gift to
Central Park. Today it sits, not on a tall pedestal but at ground
level, in the Central Park Zoo. There is also a copy -- perhaps Cain's
original -- in Les Jardins Tuileries in Paris.
