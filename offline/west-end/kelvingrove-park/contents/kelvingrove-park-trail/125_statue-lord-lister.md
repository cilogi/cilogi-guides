# Statue of Lord Lister

![Lord Lister Monument](lord-lister-monument.jpg)

[Joseph Lister][1] is famous for the pioneering of antiseptic surgery.  He
worked at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. He lived from 1827 to 1912.  He
went to University at University College London, one of hte few places
that would accept a Quaker.

Lister championed the user of carbolic acid as an antiseptic. He
noticed that it was used to reduce the stench of fields irrigated with
raw sewage, and didn't seem to hurt the livestock.

Lister worked in Glasgow until 1869, returning to Edinburgh and then
London.  He is considered to be _the father of modern surgery_.

The statue was created by [George Henry Paulin][2] (1888-1962).  Other
works by Paulin in Glasgow include: _king Robert of Sicily_ in the
Botanic Gardens; Memorial Tablet to Francis Thornton Barrett (1922) in
the Mitchell Library; Sir William Ramsay Memorial Plaque (1919) in the
University of Glasgow main building (Gilmorehill) and Portrait
Medalliions of William and John Hunter (1925) on the Hunter Memorial
immediately south of the University's main entrance on University
Avenue.
