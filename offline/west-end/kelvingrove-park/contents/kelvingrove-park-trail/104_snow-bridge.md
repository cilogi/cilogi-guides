# The Snowbridge

![The Snowbridge](snowbridge.jpg)

This bridge is the original Partick Bridge from 1800.  Dumbarton Road
crossed here before the new bridge was opened in 1878.

The bridge is a triple-arched droved ashlar masonry bridge with
pilasters and stone cut waters.  An extra arch is provided for
Bunhouse Mill Lade.

Its called the _Snowbridge_ because gates on the south side used open,
allowing snow to be swept into the Kelvin below.
