# Lobey Dosser Statue

![Lobey Dosser](lobey-dosser-statue.jpg)

This statue was created in 1992.  It is the world's only two-legged
equestrian statue.  It shows Sheriff Lobey Dosser and his nemesis Rank
Bajin riding Lobey's horse El Fideldo, better known as Elfie.

These are characters from a cartoon strip by Bud Neill.  The cartoon
started in the Evening Times in 1949 where it ran for 7 years, then
moving to the Sunday Mail.  It developed a cult following after
Neill's 1970 death.

The statue is located opposite the pub where it was conceived. It was
designed by two art students Tony Morrow and Nick Gillion based on a
drawing by Ranald MacColl, Neill's biographer and friend.

There is another statue from the same series, of G.I, Bride which was
placed in Partick Station in 2011.  This was sculpted by MacColl
himself.
