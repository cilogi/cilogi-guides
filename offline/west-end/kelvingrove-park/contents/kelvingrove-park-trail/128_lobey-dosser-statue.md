# Lobey Dosser

![Bronze of Lobey Dosser](image:lobey-dosser-statue.jpg)

This bronze was created in 1992.  It is the world's only statue of a two-legged
horse.  It shows Sheriff Lobey Dosser and his nemesis Rank
Bajin riding Lobey's horse El Fideldo, otherwise known as Elfie.

> A Lobey Dosser, in the Glasgow vernacular, is someone who sleeps in the
entrance to a tenement building -- literally _lobby sleeper_. In similar vein
a _bajin_ is Glasgow slang for _bad one_.

These are characters from a cartoon strip by [Bud Neill][1].  The cartoon
started in the Evening Times in 1949 where it ran for 7 years, then
moving to the Sunday Mail.  It developed a cult following after
Neill's 1970 death.

The statue is located opposite the pub where it was conceived. It was
designed by two art students Tony Morrow and Nick Gillion based on a
drawing by Ranald MacColl, Neill's biographer and friend.

There is another statue from the same series, of G.I, Bride which was
placed in Partick Station in 2011.  This was sculpted by MacColl
himself.

MacColl is responsible for the garden restaurant at the Ubiquitous Chip in
Ashton Lane, as well as the interior design of several pubs in the area, including:
the Lismore in Partick and the Ben Nevis on Argyle Street. Well worth a visit.
