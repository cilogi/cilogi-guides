# Port Sunlight Cottages

The so-called Port Sunlight Cottages are rare surviving relics from
the series of Great Exhibitions held in Kelvingrove Park in 1888, 1901
and 1911. These rambling, asymmetrical cottages were constructed in
1901 as replicas of the model housing constructed on Merseyside for
the Lever Brothers' Sunlight Soap workers. Designed in an idealised
Elizabethan half-timbered style by Exhibition Architect James Miller,
the houses are picturesquely sited high above the Kelvin. Donated to
the city of Glasgow by Lord Leverhulme after the close of the
Exhibition, the cottages have been used as park workers' housing ever
since.
