# Kelvingrove Bandstand

![Kelvingrove Bandstand](kelvingrove-bandstand.jpg)

Once a common feature, traditional bandstands are now increasingly
scarce in Glasgow's Victorian parks. Kelvingrove's bandstand dates
from 1924-5, and was the third built in the park (its predecessors
having been built for the 1901 and 1911 Exhibitions). Designed
in-house by the City Parks Department, the bandstand is unusual for
its amphitheatre seating and its picturesque riverside
setting. Although exceedingly popular for band concerts through the
1950s and 1960s, the bandstand fell into disuse in recent years and
consent was given to demolish and redevelop the site in the 1990s. Now
recognised as a rare example of its type, the Kelvingrove Bandstand
was listed as Category B in 2000 and is now the subject of an
ambitious community-based scheme to restore and revitalise the
facility as a venue for a wide range of open-air performances and
events.
