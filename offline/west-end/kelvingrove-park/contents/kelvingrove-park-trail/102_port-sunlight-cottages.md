# The Port Sunlight Cottages

![Port Sunlight Cottages](port-sunlight-cottages.jpg)

These cottages were built for the [1901 International Exhibition][2].  They
are in the style of the model housing created by Lever Brothers
Ltd. (now Unilever) for their workers at Port Sunlight near Liverpool.

The cottages were designed by [James Miller][1] and given to Glasgow
Council by Lever Bothers after the exhibition closed.  James Miller
was a prolific Glasgow architect.  His first commission was the
Belmont Church, in Great George Street, now derelict and due for
redevelopment.
