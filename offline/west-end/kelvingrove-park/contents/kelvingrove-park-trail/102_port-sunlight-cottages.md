# The Port Sunlight Cottages

![Port Sunlight Cottages](port-sunlight-cottages.jpg)

The cottages were built for the [1901 International Exhibition][2]. They
are in the style of the model housing created by Lever Brothers
Ltd. (now Unilever) for their workers at Port Sunlight near Liverpool.

Lever Brothers made a new type of soap invented by William Hough Watson, a Bolton chemist.

The soap formula used glycerin and vegetable oils, including Palm Oil, rather than
tallow -- an animal fat.
They made hundreds of tons of soap each week.
It was called Sunlight Soap.
Here is an advertisement for Sunlight Soap from 1915

The cottages were designed by [James Miller][1] and given to Glasgow
Council by Lever Brothers after the exhibition closed.  James Miller
was a prolific Glasgow architect.  His first commission was the
Belmont Church, in Great George Street, now derelict and due for
redevelopment.
