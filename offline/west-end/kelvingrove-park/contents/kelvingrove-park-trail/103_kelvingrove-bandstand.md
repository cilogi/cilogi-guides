![Kelvingrove Bandstand](kelvingrove-bandstand.jpg)

The bandstand was built in 1924 and open in 1925.  It was the third
bandstand in the park, others having been built for the 1901 and 1911
exhibitions.

Concerts with up to 6,000 people attending were given twice a week.
The concerts were often on BBC radio on the _Scotland Calling_
programme.
