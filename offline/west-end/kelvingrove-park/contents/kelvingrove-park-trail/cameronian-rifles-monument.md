# Cameronian Rifles Memorial

![Cameronian Rifles](cameronian-rifles-monument.jpg)

The last of the three major war memorials in Kelvingrove Park, this
monument to the Cameronians regiment (also known as the Scottish
Rifles) is also the most expressive. The use of a vivid and poignant
representation of a soldier _advancing over the top_, flanked by a
Lewis Gunner and the body of a fallen comrade, is not surprising when
one considers that the sculptor, Paul Lindsey Clark, was a decorated
captain in the First World War. Field Marshall Earl Haig unveiled the
memorial in 1924, and the inscription was amended in 1947 to
commemorate the regiment's losses in the Second World War. The
Cameronians had been formed as Lanarkshire's county regiment in 1881
and its last Regular unit was finally disbanded in 1968.
