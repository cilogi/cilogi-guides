# Highland Light Infantry Memorial

![Highland Light Infantry Memorial](highland-light-infantry-mem.jpg)

Leading Scots sculptor William Birnie Rhind was responsible for this
1906 naturalistic memorial to the HLI soldiers who died on various
South African campaigns at the start of the 20th century. Rhind was
best known for work in his native Edinburgh (in Princes Street
Gardens, in St Giles, and on the facades of the Scotsman, Jenners and
Portrait Gallery buildings), but also had commissions as far away as
Australia and Canada. His interpretation of an infantryman clambering
over a rock was the first of several dynamic military monuments in
Kelvingrove Park (although it was first proposed to be situated in
Glasgow Green).
