# Carlyle Monument

![Carlyle Monument](carlyle-monument.jpg)

Thomas Carlyle (1795-1881) was a Scottish writer and Historian.  He
was born in Ecclefeachan, Dumfriesshire. He went to University in
Edinburgh and moved to London in 1831.

His 1837 _The Frech Revolution: A History_ was the inspiration for
Dickens' _A Tale of Two Cities_.  His novel _Sartor Resartus_ was one
of the finest of the 19th century.

The statue is made from 3 blocks of grey granite by
[William Kellock Brown][1].  The memorial was commissioned in 1911, 30
years after his death.

[Whistler][2] which is the Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum.
