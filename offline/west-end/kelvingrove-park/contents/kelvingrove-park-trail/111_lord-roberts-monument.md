# Lord Roberts Monument

![Lord Roberts Monument](lord-roberts-monument.jpg)

Unveiled in 1916 on a prominent site opposite Park Gate, this stirring
bronze sculpture by Harry Bates commemorates Field Marshall Earl
Roberts of Kandahar, Pretoria and Waterford (to give him his full
title), leader of a number of Imperial campaigns. Considered to be the
finest equestrian statue of its day, it is an exact replica of a
memorial to Roberts unveiled in Calcutta in 1898. The Glasgow version
is mounted atop a tall granite plinth that is decorated with
Corinthian columns at the corners, representations of _Victory_
(poised at the front) and _War_ (sitting at the rear), and a bronze
frieze around the top that illustrates Roberts' march through
Afghanistan. Sitting astride his Arab charger, _Volonel_, Roberts now
commands a superb view over the University and beyond.
