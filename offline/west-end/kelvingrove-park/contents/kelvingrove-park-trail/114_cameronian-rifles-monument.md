# Cameronian Rifles Memorial

![Cameronian Rifles](cameronian-rifles-monument.jpg)

The statue shows a soldier _going over the top_. Next to him is a
Lewis Gunner and a dead comrade. The sculptor was Paul Lindsey Clark
who was a captain in the First World War.

Field Marshall Earl Haig unveiled the memorial in 1924. The
inscription was changed in 1947 to record the regiment's losses
in the Second World War.

The inscription reads:

> To the glorious memory of all ranks the Cameronians (Scottish
> Rifles) who, to uphold liberty and justice in the world, laid down
> their lives in the two world wars 1914-1918 and 1939-1945.

Underneath is a further inscription:

> The 6/7th battalion Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) was disbanded on
> the 31st March 1967 and the 1st regular battalion on the 14th May
> 1968 thus ending the regiments long military association with the
> City of Glasgow.

The Cameronian regiment was first formed in 1689 at Douglas Dale in
Lanarkshire. The regiment's first Colonel was the 18 year old Earl of
Angus, supported by Lieutenant Colonel
[William Cleland](/wiki/William_Cleland).

The regiment almost immediately distinguished itself by holding
Dunkeld with 1200 troops against a Highland army of 5000. They were
dogged and ingenious, even using the lead from the town's roofs to
cast bullets. When the highlanders broke they are reputed to
have said that they could fight men, but not devils.

An early description of the Cameronians:

> “The Cameronians are strictly religious, and ever act upon that
> principle, making the war a part of their religion and converting
> state policy into points of conscience. They fight as they pray, and
> pray as they fight, making every battle a new exercise of their
> faith: and believe that, in such a case, they are, as it were, under
> the banner of Christ. If they fall in battle they die in the their
> calling, as martyrs to the good cause, and believe that in thus
> shedding their blood they finish the work of their salvation. From
> such maxims and articles of faith, the Cameronians may be slain,
> never conquered. Great numbers of them have lost their lives, but
> few or none of them ever yielded.”

In 1881 the 90th, The Perthshire Light Infantry, the _Perthshire Grey
Breeks_, linked to the Cameronians as the 2nd Battalion. The
regiment's badge shows this with the Douglas Star for Lord Angus, the
first Colonel, and the bugle for the Perthshire Light Infantry.

In the first World War the first Battalion left for France in August
1914 and took part in the Battle of Mons, and the retreat to Paris.
The 2nd Battalion arrived from Malta and was almost wiped out at the
Battle of Neuve Chapelle, and again at the Battle of Fromelles.

The Regiment had 19 holders of the Victoria Cross
