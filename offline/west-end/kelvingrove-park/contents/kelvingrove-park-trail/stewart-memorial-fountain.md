# Stewart Memorial Fountain

![Stewart Memorial Fountain](stewart-memorial-fountain.jpg)

In 1870, 27-year old architect James Sellars beat off seventy-five
submissions to win an international competition to produce a monument
to the late Lord Provost Robert Stewart, the man deemed most
responsible for establishing Glasgow's first permanent supply of fresh
water from Loch Katrine. Built in 1871-2 of granite, sandstone, marble
and bronze, this flamboyant French-Scottish Gothic structure
commemorates the event with abundant imagery of the Trossachs taken
from Sir Walter Scott's narrative poem, _The Lady of the Lake._ The
Lady herself, originally gilt, stands atop the central clustered
column. Although very much an early masterpiece of the young Sellars,
substantial credit for this gloriously ornate structure must also be
given to local sculptors John Mossman and James Young. Their combined
artistic talents produced what, as The Building News noted at the
time, was _the subject of universal admiration_. The years, however,
have not been kind to the Stewart Memorial, and after a long period of
neglect and disuse, the site was the subject of a major restoration
scheme in 1988. After a couple of years of renewed activity, problems
with pipework and incessant vandalism led to the closing down of the
fountain. At present, its future is sadly unclear.
