These imposing stairs are built from grey Bonawe granite from Argyll in 1853-4.

The architect was [Charles Wilson][1] who was a principal architect of the
park area of Glasgow. His design for 22 Park Circus was executed after his death.

The cost of the stairs was reputed to be Â£10,000, which was a large sum at
this time.
