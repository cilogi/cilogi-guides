The staircase was built from grey Bonawe granite from Argyll in 1853-4.

The architect was [Charles Wilson][1],  a principal architect of the
park area of Glasgow. His design for 22 Park Circus, where Glasgow City Council conducts marriages
and other civic ceremonies, was built after his death.

The cost of the stairs was reputed to be Â£10,000, which was a large sum at
this time.
