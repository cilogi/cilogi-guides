# Curler's Rest (formerly Curlers Tavern)

The pub takes its name from the Curling pond which used to lie
opposite.  The Partick Curling Club (established 1842) had its pond
here.

There is a legend that King Charles II (1630-1685) came riding one
cold winterâ€™s day to Glasgow on what was then a lonely highway and
spotting the inviting hostelry called a halt for refreshments. Finding
it shuttered and barred, the landlord was rousted out and told to open
up in the name of the King which he did with the satisfaction that the
Merry Monarch bestowed upon the inn the right, by Royal Charter, to be
open day and night, Sundays included, in perpetuity. The Charter is
rumoured to survive today in Register House in Edinburgh.

A mural by Alasdair Gray, also in the [Hillhead Subway](pages/1)m in
the bar depicts some of its many clients including Hugh MacDiarmid,
the pen-name of Christopher Murray Grieve (1892-1978), one of
Scotland's most well known and influential poets.  He was a Communist
and a founder of the SNP.
