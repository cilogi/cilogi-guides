# The Dour Drinkers of Glasgow

Hugh MacDiarmid, 1952,

Glasgow! "This savage, wild
ridiculous city," as the playwright
"'James Bridie" called it, in a
speech in which he very properly
praised "the right kind of lunatic,
daft, Scottish panache," an attribute
most easily encountered in the
pubs, but difficult to find elsewhere
except (by accident) in the course
of a battle, a political meeting, a
love affair, a theological wrangle, or
a literary controversy.
I have never been able, despite
repeated efforts, to understand the

periodicity of those complaints
against the Scottish pub which have
been made during the past half
century. Made, I suspect, when not
by women or clergymen, either by
English visitors or by Scots who, as
Sir Walter Scott said, "unScotched
make damned bad Englishmen."
They are usually accompanied by
envious comparisons with the amenities
of English inns, which we are
told are far more sociable and cater
to family parties in a way Scottish
pubs do not. For, in the latter, at
their most typical, the rule is "men
only" and "no sitting" — you stand
at the counter with your toes in
that narrow sawdust-filled trough
which serves as a comprehensive
combined ash-tray, litter-bin, and
cuspidor. So it was when I first began

to drink nearly fifty years ago; so it
still is for the most part. Certainly
nowadays, in addition to the common
bars and to the jug (or family)
departments to which women,
mostly of a shawled, slatternly, and
extremely subfusc order, still repair
with all the ancient furtiveness,
there are bright chromium-fitted
saloon bars, cocktail bars, and other
modern accessories in the more pretentious
places. And even in most of
the ordinary bars there is now a fair
sprinkling of women not only of the
"lower orders" or elderly at that,
but gay young things, merry widows,
and courtesans. Men (if you
can call them that) even take their
wives and daughters along with
them to these meretricious, deScoticised
resorts.

Now, I am not a misogynist by
any means. I simply believe
there is a time and a place for everything
— yes, literally, everything.
And like a high proportion of my
country's regular and purposive
drinkers I greatly prefer a complete
absence of women on occasions of
libation. I also prefer a complete
absence of music and very little
illumination. I am therefore a strong
supporter of the lower — or lowest
— type of "dive" where drinking is
the principal purpose and no one
wants to be distracted from that
absorbing business by music, women,
glaring lights, chromium fittings,
too many mirrors unless sufficiently
fly-spotted and mildewed, or least
of all, any fiddling trivialities of
_l'art nouveau_. If there are still plenty
of pubs in Glasgow which conform
to these requirements and remain
frowsy and fusty enough to suit my
taste and that of my boon companions,
in another respect the old
order has changed sadly and I fear
irreversibly. Our Scottish climate —
not to speak of the soot-laden,
catarrh-producing atmosphere of
Glasgow in particular — makes us
traditionally great spirit-drinkers.
That has changed. Most of us cannot
afford — or at any rate cannot
get — much whisky or, for the matter
of that, any other spirit. There
are, of course, desperate characters
who drink methylated spirits. I
have known — and still know —
resolute souls partial to a mixture
of boot-blacking and "meth," and I
remember when I was in the Merchant
Service during the recent
War a few hardy characters who
went to the trouble of stealing old
compasses off the boats at Greenock
(where we had the largest smallboat
pool in Europe) in order to
extract from them the few drops of
spirit (well mixed with crude-oil
and verdigris) they contained. But
in Glasgow pubs today at least
ninety per cent of the drinking is of
beer — and mere "swipes" at that;
"beer" that never saw a hop. I can
remember the time when it was the
other way about. What beer was
consumed was used simply as a
"chaser" to the whisky in precisely
the same way as a "boilermaker"
in New York. For of course
you get drunk quicker on whisky
plus water than on neat whisky, and
whisky and soda is an English monstrosity
no true Scot can countenance
at all.

There are other sorry changes
in even the lowest-down pubs
which in general hold to the grim
old tradition of the true Scottish
"boozer." The question of hours,
for example. In London one can
still drink legally twenty-three hours
out of the twenty-four. That is because
London is a congeries of different
boroughs which have different
"permitted hours" so that by
switching from one borough at
closing time it is easy to find another
where "they" will still be open
for an hour or two longer. In Glasgow,
moreover, unlike London,
there are few facilities for drinking
outside the permitted hours. For
most people, that is. It will hardly
be thought that I am pleading for
decreased consumption, but I believe
that the same amount of
strong drink taken in a leisurely
way over a fair number of hours is
less harmful than the rush to
squeeze in the desired number of
drinks in the short time the law
allows. Our national poet, Robert
Burns, was right when he said:
"Freedom and whisky gang thegither."
What he meant is precisely
what my own motto means:
"They do not love liberty who fear
licence." I speak for that large
body of my compatriots who uphold
this great principle and regard
respectability and affectations of
any kind as our deadliest enemy.
There are, of course, clubs and hotels,
but _hoi polloi_ have nothing
to do with either of these.
Only a few years ago there were
also Burns Clubs which took advantage
of a loophole in the law
and did a roaring trade, especially
on Sundays. You did not require
to be introduced. You simply paid
half-a-crown at the door and automatically
became a member for the
day. The difficulty — especially for
the thirsty stranger within the
gates, and indeed for the bulk of the
citizens themselves — was to find
these places. One heard about them.
One heard, indeed, fantastic tales
of the alcoholic excesses which went
on there. But they were exceedingly
difficult to find. You had to be "in
the know." Suddenly they disappeared
entirely. I have never been
able to discover why. There was
nothing in the press — and I could
learn nothing over my private
grapevine either — about police
action having been taken. They
must have been very profitable to
those who ran them, and a substantial
source of revenue to the "liquor
trade" generally. They served a
very useful purpose since no one not
resident in a hotel and not a member
of a club could otherwise get a
drink in Glasgow on Sundays. (It
was — and is still — jolly difficult
to get a meal even.)
During these two wars there
were all kinds of interferences with
the incidence and duration of the
"permitted hours." Quite a proportion
of licence-holders got it into
their heads that they could close
earlier than the decreed closingtime
— and even take a weekly
half-holiday and in some cases shut
shop and go off for a week's holiday
in the summer time. They still do,
and act arbitrarily in many other
ways. All that is, of course, quite
illegal, although the magistracy and
police authorities turned a blind
eye at these irregularities and even
welcomed them. The fact is, of
course, as the very term "public
house" shows, that the condition of
the licence obliges the licenceholder
to have his place at the disposal
of citizens at all times — not
necessarily for drinking at all; a
citizen is entitled to have the use of
these places whenever he wants if
only to use the lavatory or shelter
from the weather, or read his newspaper,
or meet a friend. It would, in
practice, be virtually impossible to
fight this and other corrupt practices
the authorities have winked at.
Recognizing this, some of us tried
to organise a "Consumers' Union,"
since the consumers are the only
unorganised and helpless factor in
the liquor situation. It proved
impossible; the consumers won't combine.
They are far too individualistic.
Though such a Consumers'
Union might have been very useful
in certain connections vis-h-vis the
Liquor Trade, the Municipal, State,
and Police Authorities and every
variety of blue-nosed snooper, I am
on many other counts enough of an
"unregenerate sinner" not to regret
that the effort failed. Yet at times
I like to toy with the idea that if it
had been possible to organize even a
high proportion of pub-users (leaving
out consumers who consume
elsewhere) the result would have
been one of the strongest organizations
in the world. No Trade Union,
or combination of Trade Unions,
would have been a patch on it.

I trust I have made myself clear.
The majority of Glasgow pubs
are for connoisseurs of the morose,
for those who relish the element of
degradation in all boozing and do
not wish to have it eliminated by
the introduction of music, modernistic
fitments, arty effects, or other
extraneous devices whatsoever. It
is the old story of those who prefer
hard center chocolates to soft, storm
to sunshine, sour to sweet. True
Scots always prefer the former of
these opposites. That is one of our
principal differences from the English.
We do not like the confiding,
the intimate, the ingratiating, the
hail-fellow-well-met, but prefer the
unapproachable, the hard-bitten,
the recalcitrant, the sinister, the
malignant, the sarcastic, the saturnine,
the cross-grained and the
cankered, and the howling wilderness
to the amenities of civilization,
the irascible to the affable, the
prickly to the smooth. We have no
damned fellow-feeling at all, and
look at ourselves and others with the
eye of a Toulouse Lautrec appraising
an obscene old toe-rag doing
the double-split. In short, we are all
poets (all true Scots — that is, all
Scots not encased in a carapace of
conventionality a mile thick) of
_l'humour noir_ and, as William Blake
said, "All poets are of the devil's
party."
There is a well-known story about
Carlyle and Emerson spending several
hours together without exchanging
a word. Carlyle declared
it was one of the best nights he ever
spent with anybody. A lot of us
spend many nights in Scottish pubs
in the same way and we agree with
Carlyle. Scotland produces a type
of man who can dispense more completely
than any with what James
Joyce called "the atrocities of human
intercourse."

There is nothing less exportable
than a national sense of humor.
The Scottish temper I am writing
about is little known abroad. Our
internationally famous comedians
purvey a very different account
of us. The sorry joke is that so
many Scots believe the latter and
model themselves all too successfully
on it. Yet what I am trying to
express is well-enough known about
us in other connections. It is this
that for centuries has made the
Scottish soldier famous as a bayonet fighter.
A similar preference for
naked steel runs through every
phase of our life. It is summed up
in the old Gaelic proverb: "Fingal's
sword never needs to cut twice."
Burns says in one of his poems that
you need not be "nice" with him.
No one need be "nice" with any
true Scotsman — in fact, he will
not allow it at all. The only kind of
friendships one makes — or wishes
to make or could tolerate at all —
in such pubs were well described by
my friend, the great Irish poet, the
late W. B. Yeats, when he wrote:
"I called him a knave and a fool —
But friendship never dies!"

In other words, the injunction
which is as one with the Very marrow
of our bones is "Woe to him of
whom all men speak well." We have
no use for emotions, let alone sentiments,
but are solely concerned with
passions.

One of the best essayists on aspects
of Scottish literature, Mr. J. D.
Scott, has pointed out how deep in
Scottish life are the roots of this
"slow and vicious enjoyment," this
"formidable and ferocious scorn."
It is the tremendous animating principle
of three of the greatest modern
Scottish novels — George Douglas
Brown's _House With the Green Shutters_. R. L. Stevenson's unfinished
_Weir of Hermiston_, and Sydney
Goodsir Smith's super-Rabelaisan
story of Edinburgh today (doing
for it what Joyce's Ulysses did for
Dublin), _Carotid Cornucopius_. It is
precisely this element, utterly different
from English humor, that
is the essence of any number of the
most typical Scottish anecdotes.
Like, for example, the story of the
minister who told his congregation
that in a dream he had seen them
all in Hell suffering the tortures
of the damned. "Ye lifted up your
eyes to the Almighty God and
ye said to Him, 'O Lord, we didna
ken it would be like this', and
the Lord God Almighty, (slowly
and unctuously) in His infinite
mercy and compassion, looked down
upon ye and He said, 'Weel, nooye
ken!'"

We — (if I may speak for all of
us) do not go to pubs for chitchat,
we do not wish them crossed
with some sort of cafe or tea-party
or concert or damned conversazione;
we are fond enough of our womenfolk,
but there are times when we
want away from them as no doubt
there are times when they want to
be away from us. The keynote of
Glasgow life is still expressed in the
song sung by Will Fyffe, the great
Scottish comedian who died four
years ago, which runs:

"I belong to Glasgow.
I'm only a common working chap,
But when I get two or three drinks
on a Saturday night
Glasgow belongs to me!"

Our attitude is not inhuman. We
are experienced men of the world.
We like what we like to be a little
grim — in keeping with the facts of
life, and loathe facile emotions. We
cherish no illusions, and consequently
prefer a mutual taciturnity
to any sort of social joy, standing
shoulder to shoulder with other men
we do not know from Adam and do
not want to know. We feel no necessity
whatever to indulge in any airs
and graces, are not fond of promiscuous
conversation, at least of any sustained
sort, and if bur risible faculties
are moved at all by the human
spectacle, that movement only adorns
our faces intermittently with some
sort of _risus sardonicus_ that in flicking
across our features barely interrupts
the emission of the dense smoke of
the black tobacco going well in our
clay pipes. It is, indeed, a sort of
fleeting facial comment hardly distinguishable
from the effect of that
gagging which an unwarily deep
swig at what passes for Scotch
Whisky is apt to etch on the granitic
features of even the most hardened
soak.

Elsewhere I have summed up my
regard for Glasgow in a brief poem
"Placenta Previa" which runs:

"It'll be no easy matter to keep the
dirt in its place
And get the Future out alive in _this_ case.

On the last Hogmanay night
(New Year's Eve), as on all its predecessors,
no matter how dourly
and darkly I take my pleasures, the
same way some people keep snakes
for pets, I once again, with a great
upsurge of savage joy, recalled
another verse of mine and practised
what I preach, namely:

"O this is time for all mankind
To rejoice without a doubt
— And break the neck of the bottle
It the cork will not come out!"

And that is precisely how Scots
do bring in the New Year. They
gather in the public squares of their
cities and towns, and as the bells
ring out the Old Year and ring in
the New, they empty their bottles
and smash them on the street. On
this most recent Hogmanay I was
one of a company of many uproarious
hundreds doing this in George
Square, Glasgow, undeterred by the
fact that a day of gale and sleet was
giving way to snow and ice and that
hundreds of people in Glasgow alone
had been rendered homeless by
blown-down houses or injured in the
streets by falling chimney-pots and
lorn-off slates.

A wild night, so our merriment
had to be correspondingly wild to
lift our hearts above its hazards. A
typical incident was the ripping
apart of a newly-built school. It
was hurled by the gale towards a
house occupied by a family of KelJvs.
One section of the steel-framed
The 'American Mercury
school was lifted in the air and
wrapped round an electric standard
at the Kelly's back fence. That
standard saved the Kelly house. If it
hadn't been there the school would
have gone right through the house.

Hail Caledonia, stern and wild!

Scott Fitzgerald speaks of "Jay
Gatsby breaking up like glass
against Tom Buchannan's hard malice."
I sometimes think all the
shams and unveracities in the world
will break up in the same way
against the Scottish spirit of which
I am writing. Scots of that particular
mettle are the very salt of the
earth. I am one of them and so I
know. It would not pay anyone to
dispute the point in any ot the Glasgow
pubs I frequent
.
Let me finish this Scottish letter
on a different note altogether.
Otherwise it will not be true to
Scotland which is a country ot
sharp transitions and extraordinary
variety, in its landscape, weather,
people and everything else. Glasgow
is only a part of it, and utterly
unrepresentative of the rest. Well,
I was talking to an Edinburgh man
yesterday and I said something
about the unexpectable character of
Scottish scenery, and Scottish life.
And he pulled me up at once.
"Nonsense," he said, "there is
nothing inexplicable — nothing to
account for which almost anybody
cannot devise at once some reasonable
hypothesis." And he challenged
me to give an example. I replied
that I was walking across a moor in
Rosshire one summer afternoon.
There wasn't a soul in sight, hardly
an animal, only a bird or two. It
was almost twelve miles to the nearest
village. Suddenly among the
heather I spied a yellow glove. It
was almost brand-new, did not look
as if it had been worn at all. I picked
it up and as I did so I heard a clicking
noise inside it. I took it by the
tip of one of the fingers and shook it
gently — and out fell four fingernails
and a thumbnail, the complete
set of nails from one hand. They
were perfectly clean, like sea shells.
However they had come off it had
quite obviously neither been through
any disease nor violence. It was impossible
to conceive a man drawing
off his glove and his nails with it,
tossing them into the heather, and
walking on unaware, or, if aware, as
if nothing had happened. I found it
— and find it — impossible to imagine
the state of mind of a man who
a few miles further on discovered he
had done just that. I have been
haunted ever since by a sense of the
horrible blunt feeling of nailless
fingertips. I should have thought in
such a case a man would have reported
the matter to the police or
discussed it with friends and that
somehow or other news of such an
extraordinary occurrence would have
got round and out, and even into
the papers. I made all sorts of inquiries
and found that nothing was
known or could be discovered about
the matter. I enquired of medical
friends and found that no known
disease could account for it and that
no similar case was cited in any
medical or scientific book known to
them.

I have bever succeeded in solving
the mystery or getting any light
on it at all. But it can certainly
serve as a parable of much that has
happened in what has been called
"the self-suppression of the Scot"
and the way he had sloughed off his
literature, history, native languages,
and much else in the past two and a
half centuries. Another and equal
mystery is the way in which he is
today resuming them, just as if the
nailless finger-ends were suddenly
growing new nails. There is widespread
agreement that a great Scottish
National Reawakening is in
progress. I'd know more about that
if I could hit on any explanation of
the preceding loss. As matters stand,
I take it, in the Scots law phrase, to
_avizandum_, i.e. defer for further
consideration. And yet I am conscious
of my inability to make up
my mind to deal with the situation
because there are no facts on which
one can make up one's mind, and a
pressing desire to seize on small
clues, to build up something in
order that one may do something —
_anything_ — knowing all the time
that if one _did_ do something it
would probably be wrong because
the basic facts are missing. Whether
I am right or not in fancying that
this is something that could only
have happened in Scotland, I think
it will be agreed that it is exceedingly
 unlikely ever to have happened anywhere before and highly
improbable that it will ever happen
again. Above all, I wonder how the
hell I invented it at all. Apart from
just being Scotch, of course
-- really Scotch.

Home, Home to the Bar

The saloon is coming back because it is an organic necessity. It is
essentially and peculiarly American. It was born of our hurry, our
hatred of leisure, our disdain of elegancies, manners, table-cloths.
In Europe the people from time immemorial have sat down to
drink; they have made of it a sacrament to go with leisurely eating.
But "Sacrament be damned!" said the early men of the Republic.
"I want five fingers quick — and then another!" Europe sips her
drinks. We sip nothing. We throw in a whiskey, a beer, a cocktail,
just as we gulp down Haiti, Cuba, the Philippines, Nicaragua, a
World War, all the great musicians of Europe, Proust, Trader Horn,
fifty million automobiles a year, and four or five new religions.
The saloon was thus a healthy growth, a normal growth, an organic
extension of our healthy gullets and bellies. "This is hell!" said a
four-generation American friend of mine when he first hit Paris. "I've
got to sit down to get drunk! Where's that American Bar I heard
about?" An American seeing the word Bar in any quarter of the
globe immediately returns to his tribe. His eye dances, his mouth
waters, his spine runs up the Stars and Stripes. In going toward that
sign, he is going home. He'll see Chicago Jim or Bowery Pete behind
the long mahogany. He'll stand before a bottle and a glass, and with
his foot on a shining rail he'll salute with loving thought the spirits
of Andy Jackson, Kit Carson and General Grant — all grand American
bar-flies in their day. You can no more ultimately dissever a real
American from the saloon than you can part Herbert Hoover from
his decorations.
