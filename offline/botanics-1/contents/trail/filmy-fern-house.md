### Filmy Fern House

![Ferns in the filmy Fern house](images/filmy-fern-house.jpg)

The fern house dates back over 100 years to late
Victorian times and can be seen on the OS map of
1895. Glasgow is considered to have one of the best
filmy fern houses in the country, which is due to the
purity of Glasgow's water.
A tour of the above facilities is available on request Ask
at the Gardens office.
