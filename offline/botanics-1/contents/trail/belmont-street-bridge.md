The Belmont Street Bridge was built in 1870 on ground
belonging to the City of Glasgow Bank to give access
from Great Western Road to the North Woodside area.
Its high elliptical masonry arch pierced with stone
parapets and rusticated abutments carries Belmont
Street over the river. A subsidiary cast-iron span with six
ribs and lattice railings carrying the street over
Garriochmill Road was replaced in 1971 in concrete.
