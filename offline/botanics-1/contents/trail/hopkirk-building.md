### Hopkirk Building

![Head of Thomas Hopkirk](images/hopkirk-head.jpg)

This building is dedicated to Thomas Hopkirk who was
one of the founders of the Botanic Gardens. Built on the
site of an old smaller potting shed, it has undergone a
refurbishment to turn it into a multi-functional space
which is available for schools to carry out science
studies during visits to the Gardens.
