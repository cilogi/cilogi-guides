Lychnis chalcedonica is also known as
_Burning Love, Dusky Salmon, Flower of Bristol, Jerusalem Cross, or Maltese Cross_

Growing 35–100 cm (14–39 in) tall with unbranched stems, it is an herbaceous perennial.
The leaves are produced in opposite pairs, simple broad [lanceolate][1], 2–12 cm (1–5 in)
long and 1-5 cm broad. The flowers are produced in clusters of 10-50 together;
each flower is bright red, 1-3 cm in diameter, with a deeply five-lobed corolla,
each lobe being further split into two smaller lobes. This forms a general shape similar to that of the Maltese cross
to which it owes one of its common names. The fruit is a dry capsule containing numerous seeds.
