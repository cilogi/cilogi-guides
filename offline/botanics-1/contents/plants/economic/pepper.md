The ancient Greeks imported pepper from India both as a spice and as a medicine.
Even today the finest black pepper, known as _Black Gold_, still comes from the
[Malabar coast](/wiki.html?target=Malabar_Coast) of south India.
Powdered, it is one of the main ingredients of the
mixed spices that are the basic of curry powders.

[Ayurvedic medicine](/wiki.html?target=Ayurvedic_medicine)uses black pepper for the alleviation of colds, coughs, catarrh
and bronchial complaints.  In is also used in preparations for constipation.

One of the chemical constituents of black pepper is [piperine](/wiki.html?target=Piperine),
which is identical in
composition to morphia and so has been used traditionally in India in medicines for
cholera.

Once, during the height of the Portuguese trade, the growers of black pepper ran in alarm to their
sovereign, the [Zamorin of Calicut](/wiki.html?target=Zamorin).
"Portuguese merchantmen are not just stowing away our pepper,
they are uprooting and carrying off the very pepper vines themselves." "Let them", said the Zamorin calmly.
"Can they take with them that last monsoon rain that gives the pepper its special flavour?"
