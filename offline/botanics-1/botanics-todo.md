# Botanics to-do

Time to get the Botanics sample up and running.  Target for the end of
the week.

Things to do.

1. Set up front splash page.  
2. Sort out sequencing for trail (and more generally)
3. Rest of content

    * Useful info (opening etc)
    * Signage for at least 1 external item
    * Content for 4 or 5 internal plants
    * Signage for 1 internal plant
    * Fake shop content
    * Check on map
    * Integration of disqus

I should also spend some more time on the manual.  Getting this right
will be important.

## Bug fixes

* Sequencing for blog is broken, getting wrong references.
