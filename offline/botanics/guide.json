This guide is _not_ offline.\n\nThe principal features of our platform are:\n\n1. Guides are web applications containing text, images, audio and\nvideo, running on high-end mobile phones;\n\n2. Visitors access guides by capturing a QR code on camera or entering\na short URL by keyboard. Browsing starts immediately at any point\nin the guide. You don't have to go through a gateway, or download\nan application;\n\n\n2. A short numeric code can be entered with an on-screen keypad to get\ninformation about an specific which has a physical label with\nthe code;\n\n![A keypad (with label shown as overlay) provides instant access to exhibits](image:keypad-code.png)\n\n3. Guides contain an integrated shop which provides offers\nfor individual exhibits, and immediate in-guide purchasing;\ndata-analytics\n3. Guides provide detailed analytics about their use, so you can see\nwhat what visitors do, and what they are interested in.\n\n4. Guides run offline, without an Internet connection.  They work\ninside buildings when you are out of 3G and WiFi range.\n\n5. Guides are fully integrated with Wikipedia and other public\ninformation sources. This lets you both enrich the information\nprovided to visitors and enables collaborative engagement with the\nvisitor community.\n\n6. Guides are created using a simple file-based\ncontent management system (CMS). You can create a guide just by\nentering text in your preferred editor and dropping images into a\ndirectory on your computer;\n\n6. Guides are free -- Cilogi does not charge for creation or delivery.\nWe can do this because our platform is efficient and because we\ntake a small fee from items sold in the shop.\n\nLet's look at these features in more detail.\n\n## Guides as Web Applications\n\nA variety of mobile guides to Museums and other collections have been\nproduced. These have exclusively been developed as _apps_, mainly for\nthe iPhone.\n\nOur guides are HTML5 mobile websites (sometimes called web apps).\nThere are several reasons for choosing websites over apps.\n\n* Websites are part of the web.  You can access any page of\na website via a public URL.  This lets you jump right into a guide\nat any page.\n* Websites cover a wider range of devices whereas apps are for a\nsingle platform.  Mobile apps which run multi-platform are usually\njust a wrapper round a website (see PhoneGap for example).\n* It is possible to make payments from mobile websites without having\nto pay Apple a tax of 30%.\n\nThe two main advantages of apps are that developers can easily get\npaid for them, and that in an app you have access to phone capabilities,\nsuch as the camera, that you don't from the web browser.  Neither of\nthese apply to our guides as they are free, and we don't need access\nto phone capabilities.\n\n## Discovery via QR codes and URLs\n\nHow do you get to find out about a guide?  Our solution is to provide\n[QR codes](/wiki/QR_code) and\n[short code URLs](/wiki/URL_shortener)\nthroughout the collection.  A QR code leads to the guide when you take\na picture of it with the phone's camera; a short code URL can be typed\nin with little effort.\n\nThese codes can be placed on exhibits, wherever there is space.  In a\ngarden for example we may place a QR code on small label on a\ntree. The web page to which this leads will describe the tree (or\nother exhibit), and from this page the whole guide is available, as\nshown in the image below, which is from\n[this page](http://xstatic.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tim@timniblett.net/botanics/contents/trail/weeping-ash.html).\n\n![Weeping Ash from the Glasgow Botanics Gardens](image:weeping-ash.jpg)\n\nA page linked in this way provides a seamless and elegant means of\nentering a guide, even for visitors who may not have intended using\nthe guide in the first instance.\n\n## Keypad to navigate directly to exhibits\n\nOnce the guide has been launched simple numeric codes can be used to\nmove directly to pages for individual exhibits.  All that is required\nis for the number to be placed with the exhibit.\n\n![A keypad (with label shown as overlay) provides instant access to exhibits](image:keypad-code.png)\n\nThe advantage of a small code is that is can be placed discreetly with\nsmall exhibits, so that items in a crowded display case can be\nindividually located and examined.  For many collections this is a\nsignificant issue as display cases contain many exhibits and there is\nsimple not room to provide adequate signage for all of them.\n\n## An integrated shop\n\nYou are most likely to buy something when you're looking at an\nexhibit, your enthusiasm is sparked, and you'd like to follow this up,\nusually by buying something. Our guides let you do this by saying\nwhich item(s) is(are) likely to be of interest for any exhibit. In a\ngallery this might be a framed print of the picture you're looking at,\nor a book about the artist who painted the picture.  In a garden it\nmay be the opportunity to buy a cutting, or seeds for, a particular\nplant.\n\nPurchases are made via PayPal.  Other mobile-capable gateways will be\nintroduced over time.  The critical features of a payment method are\nthat (a) you don't need to worry about security, (b) you don't\nhave to input more than the minimum of personal details (email and\npassword), and (c) you're already signed up to it.\n\nYou set up a store by providing a comma separated file, which is\nparsed, converted to [JSON](/wiki/JSON) and\nloaded (asynchronously) when any page of the website is loaded.  The\ncomma separated file can easily be output from a database.\n\nIn order to take advantage of the link between exhibits and items in\nthe shop you either have to extend your database to include this\ninformation or provide a structured text file which specifies this\nlinkage.\n\nOur guides work offline.  This inevitably limits the amount of data\nwhich can be stored for any shop. An offline shop should not contain\nmore than 250 items.  If you need more then online mode should be used\n(see our discussion below).\n\nWhen you're offline you can't buy anything, as an Internet connection\nis required to charge a credit card.  You can fill your shopping cart\nwhile offline, but if you try to pay you'll get a message telling you\nyou're offline and offering to provide a reminder as soon as you get\nonline again.  This reminder can only be sent when the guide is being\ndisplayed. This limitation is inevitable and means that you should\nmake sure that there is either 3G or WiFi coverage at the entrances\nand exits to the collection, if not throughout.\n\n## Web analytics with Guides\n\nWeb analytics are in widespread use for desktop web sites.  Analytics\nfor mobile guides are even more powerful as information is available\nabout the route visitors take through the collection via the order of\npages visited.  Analytics can be used to optimise the information\nprovided in the guide and to track and optimise the performance of the\nshop.\n\nStandard analytics packages such as Google Analytics has a\nproblem when used with guides -- you don't get information when\nyou're offline.\n\nWe are actively looking at solutions to this issue. As with shopping\nthe best solution is store tracking information when offline and send\nit when online again. We are looking at ways of doing this with Google\nanalytics.\n\nWe have location information from visitors by assuming location from\nshort URL and QR code inputs, together with keypad inputs.  The\nmapping feature of our guides\n[e.g see here](http://xstatic.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/tim@timniblett.net/botanics/diagrams/botanics.html)\nprovides location.  It may prove useful for Cilogi to provide its own\nAnalytic information, or to process third party information such as\nfrom Google Analytics to allow collections to examine vistors' paths\nthrough the collection.\n\n## Offline guides\n\nIn many collections 3G is not available -- building can be problematic\n-- and WiFi has not been installed.  In these circumstances it is more\ndifficult to provide a mobile guide.\n\nOur guides can be available offline.\n[Offline caching](http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/offline.html) of\napplications is an HTML5 feature which Cilogi implements as an option\nfor each guide.\n\nOf course, an offline guide has to be downloaded at some point. The\nsimplest way to enable this is to provide WiFi at the entrance to the\ncollection, or to make sure that WiFi and/or 3G is available\nthroughout the collection, if not everywhere.  Its tactful to _not_\nplace QR codes and short URLs in places where there is no connection!\n\nThe current state of mobile browsers means that offline sites cannot\nbe larger that 5 or 10MB on the major platforms.  This is not enough\nfor many Cilogi guides.  We therefore use\n[WebSQL](http://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/) to extend this to 50MB or\nmore.  WebSQL is due to be superseded, at which point we will need to\nlook for another solution.\n\nOffline web sited require a radical change in architecture. Cilogi has\nsuch an architecture. Our architecture is client-centric.  The flow of\ncontrol between pages occurs on the mobile phone and services are\nrequested from central servers as required. No service is essential,\nguaranteeing that visitors have an excellent experience when offline.\n\nWhen offline, pages must be stored or generated on the client. A\npre-compiled static page is usually sufficient.  When it is not (for\nexample to generate dynamic views of an online store) a database,\ntemplates and control code must be present on the client.\n\nOur compilation process sets up all these when the website is\ngenerated.  Databases are stored as JSON with query access via canned\nJavaScript code. The JSON is usually embedded into JavaScript files,\nand thereby loaded when the website is first accessed.\n\nFor the guides to work offline its essential that all the code is\nloaded with the first page.  For a medium-sized site with full text\nsearch the volume of code will be less than 500KB.\n\nOur guides function as single page websites, and aggressive caching is\nused (unique file names and far future expiry) so that this hit only\nhappens on initial load.\n\nThree examples of the architectural implications of offline websites\nas guides:\n\n### Templating and databases\n\nShopping pages are traditionally generated by using a database, containing\ninformation about the items available, offers, etc. and a set of\ntemplates which are filled in using information from the database.\n\nCilogi generates shopping pages in much the same way except that the\ntemplates are client-side (using jQuery Templates) and the database is\nconverted at compile time into a JSON file which is loaded on startup\nas part of the code base.\n\n### Search\n\n![Full text search interface.  Search works offline and for dynamically added content](image:search.png)\n\nCilogi provides a simple full text search facility.  As with the database\nit is possible to generate an inverted index at compile time and we do\nthis. However, we also allow additional pages from Wikipedia and other\nsources to be added at runtime, so a hybrid strategy is used for\nsearch, with additional pages being processed on-the-fly in JavaScript.\n\n### Tours\n\nA tour is an ordered sequence of stops, each stop of which is an\nexhibit or feature of the collection.  Cilogi supports tours in two\nways.\n\n1. A tour is _compiled_ when the guide is generated.  Compilation\ninvolves getting the tour definition, basically a list of exhibits,\nfrom a database or structured text file, creating an overview page\nfor the tour and inserting links into page of the tour.\n2. The tour specification is downloaded when the guide is accessed.\nThe overview page is generated on the fly using a template, and the\nindividual tour pages are modified on the fly to add the necessary\nlinks.\n\nWhich of these approaches is best depends on whether a single page\ncan be part of more than one tour. If so, then the second approach is\nmandated. Otherwise the first is simpler.\n\n![A tour page built from a client-side template and a tour specification](image:tour-page.jpg)\n\nA couple of points should be made about each approach.  In the\ncompilation approach links are inserted directly into the HTML\ndocument, using the [Jsoup](http://jsoup.org/) HTML5 parser. This is\nsignificant as it means that tours operate as a _module_.  A tour can\nbe added simply by adding its specification.  You don't have to htink\nabout how this feature will interact with others.\n\nThe on-the-fly approach depends on (a) use of persistent storage -- we\nuse [HTML local storage](http://dev.w3.org/html5/webstorage/) and (b)\nthe ability to intercept and modify pages before they are displayed.\nThis latter ability is provided by the\n[jQuery Mobile](/wiki/JQuery_Mobile) framework,\nwhich is the web framework we use.  jQuery Mobile provides first class\nsupport for iOS, Android and Blackberry 6.\n\n## Integration with Wikipedia and Wikitravel\n\nNo-one has the resources to provide comprehensive information relating\nto all the exhibits in a collection. For instance a gallery may have a\nwork by\n[Alberto Giacometti](/wiki/Alberto_Giacometti)\non display. As a visitor I may be interested in looking at other work,\noutside the collection, by this artist and then following up on these\nartists. Its just not possible to provide all this information as a\nsingle organisation.\n\nLinking to Wikipedia provides the ability to explore more widely from\na given starting point.\n\nWikipedia (and WikiTravel) content can be incorporated in three ways\ninto Cilogi guides:\n\n* A link to Wikipedia can be included in text;\n* The\n[transclusion](/wiki/Wikipedia:Transclusion)\nof a Wikipedia article can be included on a page;\n\n![Transclusion of a Wikipedia article, starting with the image of Black Pepper](image:pepper.jpg)\n\n* A page can just _be_ a Wikipedia page.\n\nIn each of these three cases the Wikipedia content is available\noffline and is a fully integrated part of the guide.  In addition any\nWikipedia pages visited via links are available offline and are\nindexed by our full text search capability.\n\n## File-based content management system\n\nAuthors can generate guides just by editing text files, and by\ndropping images into the appropriate directory. Work can be shared, so\nthat multiple authors can work  on a guide simultaneously.\n\nPages are written in [Markdown](/wiki/Markdown), a simple markup\nlanguage which allows pages to be created with a simple text editor.\nHere is an example:\n\n# Title\n\nMarkdown is structured text, like Wiki syntax\nbut simpler.\n\n* Lists are easy\n* just use an asterisk\n* Links [like this](/wiki/Link]\n\n![An image](image:botanic-flower.jpg)\n\n\nAuthors work on a local folder attached to\n[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/). An author signs up to Cilogi and\nreceives an invitation to share a Dropbox folder.  Any changes and\nedits are automatically shared with Cilogi.  Cilogi monitors the file\nsystem and any changes to a marker file trigger compilation and launch\nof the guide.\n\nCilogi checkmarks each version of the site (using Git)\nand any recent version can be recovered if there is a problem.  A new\nversion must be approved before it moves from staging, so the author\ncan check and approve a guide before it is launched to the public.\n\nIt is possible to edit guides remotely using the Chrome Web Browser\nand the [SourceKit](https://github.com/kenotron/sourcekit) editor.\n\nCollaborative work on articles can be performed on Wikipedia or other\nopen wikis.  There are also a number of closed wiki tools that can be\nused, and which have an API Cilogi can access.  This is the most\nappropriate mechanism for public collaboration on guides.\n\n## Free to develop and deliver\n\nIt is free to develop guides, and free to deliver them to visitors.\nYou retain ownership of the content, which sits in a folder on your\ncomputer.\n\nWe are using cloud infrastructure, currently from Amazon with\n[S3](/wiki/Amazon_S3), Google with\n[App Engine](/wiki/App_Engine) and\n[Dropbox](/wiki/Dropbox_(service)).\n\nUsing the cloud eliminated fixed infrastructure costs, and to a large\nextent the requirement for in-house maintenance.  Costs are\nfurther reduced by minimizing work beyond simple file serving.\nExtensive customization of pages, a la Facebook, for each individual\nuser can be very expensive in computing resources, particularly for\nbursty traffic.\n\nCilogi's architecture is that of a JavaScript(CoffeeScript, Dart, GWT\nif you prefer) application on the client with\n[REST](/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)\nservices provided from Cilogi's infrastructure.\n\nMobile phones are personal devices so JavaScript-based customization\non a per-user basis works well and provides most of what a\nserver-based solution can.  Services such as\n[Disqus](/wiki/Disqus), work on mobile websites\nand require only JavaScript (and\n[JSON](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP)). If\nnecessary it is possible to password protect sensitive information via\nencryption.\n\n-----\n\nCilogi currently works on two cloud platforms,\n[Amazon S3](/wiki/Amazon_S3) and\n[Google App Engine](/wiki/App_Engine). Amazon\nS3 supports purely static sites, with web services only available via\nJSONP.  App Engine provides a scalable full-service platform.\n\nCareful design has been required for App Engine to ensure that costs are\ncontained.  Static web serving is possible from App Engine for very\nlittle more than the cost of outgoing data.\n\nAt present App Engine is used for services, although other platforms\ncan be used.  An advantage of App Engine is that images, which generate\nof about 80% of a site's outgoing bandwidth are served from Google's\nvery efficient content delivery network (CDN).  With conservative\nassumptions the total cost of delivering a complete guide will be about\n£0.005 per visitor.\n\n\n\n"},{"id":1720,"title":"Our Flora","url":"contents/plants/index.md","metaData":{"background":["weeping-ash-background.jpg"],"index":["1720"],"listview":["true"],"search":["true"]},"etag":"NfnOYpCh-nDA92L53J7Me0A1rtoQXzBF57JPfLReUa4=","text":"* [Begonias](listing:begonias)\n* [Economically important plants](listing:economic)\n* [Chronological Border](page:11)\n* [Trees](tour:tree-trail)\n"},{"id":5000,"title":"History of Glasgow Botanic Gardens","images":["![Sandyford](image:sandyford.jpg)","![Plan of the Botanic Gardens at Sandyford, 1827](image:sandyford-plan-1827)"],"url":"contents/history/index.md","metaData":{"index":["5000"],"isGallery":["true"]},"etag":"q8EComDfUE6PQ5p3YxqwL1NhMhSp_8HtFC_KbX09bnM=","text":"Glasgow Botanic Gardens have had a varied history.  They evolved from\na Physic Garden established in the grounds of the old College in 1704,\nfor teaching purposes and maintained for about one hundred years.  The\nGardens were ultimately re-established in the West End in May 1817,\nwhen the work of laying out a botanic garden was begun on an eight\nacre site at Sandyford, at the west end of Sauchiehall Street\n\n\nThis site was acquired by [Thomas Hopkirk](/wiki/Thomas_Hopkirk) who founded the Royal Botanic\nInstitution of Glasgow. The Institution managed the Gardens until they\nwere taken over by the Corporation in 1891.\n\n![Thomas Hopkirk](image:hopkirk.jpg)\n\nFunds were raised by public subscription, and the University made a\nsubstantial contribution on the understanding that a room was set\naside for the Professor of Botany to deliver lectures, and that plant\nmaterial for the students was also supplied by the gardens. In 1818\nthe Crown gave a donation and also granted a [Royal Charter](/wiki/Royal_charter). Also in\nthat year the University appointed the first Regius Professor of\nBotany, [Dr Robert Graham](/wiki/Robert_Graham_%28botanist%29), and he took an active part in the formation\nof the new Gardens. Hopkirk gifted the plants cultivated in his own\ngarden at Dalbeth to form the nucleus of the new Botanic Gardens.\n\n[William Jackson Hooker](/wiki/William_Jackson_Hooker),\none of the most outstanding of British botanists. was appointed to the\nchair of Botany at Glasgow in 1821. He was largely responsible for the\nremarkable success of the Gardens in the early years. This was a\nperiod when many new plants were being introduced into cultivation and\nHooker carried out much of the work on the description of these\nspecies, and the publication of botanical drawings of them. It was\nmainly due to his work that within ten years of its foundation Glasgow\nBotanic Gardens already had a prominent position in the world of\nbotany.\n\n![William Jackson Hooker, 1850s](image:william-hooker-1850s.jpg)\n![Illustration by Hooker: Banksia Integrifolia](image:banksia_integrifolia.jpg)\n\nThe rapid expansion of Glasgow soon made the small eight acre site at\nSandyford unsuitable and by 1839 an area had been purchased in the\nnewly opened estate of\nKelvinside. [Sir Joseph Paxton](/wiki/Joseph_Paxton)\n(1803-65) was commissioned to design a new garden on the lands on the\nsouth bank of the gorge section of the River Kelvin.\n\nThe crucial years of transfer to the Kelvinside site were the peak of\nStewart Murray's long and distinguished career as the first Curator of\nthe Botanic Garden. In part the structure of the Gardens we know today\nwas laid down by him.\n\n![Stewart Murray Layout](image:stewart-murray-layout.jpg)\n\nThis plan taken from the 1842 map by R. Manin shows the original\nlayout planned by Stewart Murray.\n\nMurray was born in Aberdeenshire in April 1790. Little is known of his\nearly years, but by the time he was 17 he was in Glasgow. As a\ngardener at nearby Dalbeth he was much involved with Thomas Hopkirk1s\nplant collection and he was appointed Curator of the new Botanic\nGarden in 1817. As well as being a skilled and knowledgeable\nplantsman, Murray was a landscape designer of some note. Not only was\nthe layout of both Botanic Gardens principally his but he was closely\ninvolved in the layout of the Glasgow Necropolis and he designed and\nlaid out the cemeteries at Sighthill, Glasgow, and at Paisley and\nGreenock. After retiring in 1852 he continued as Consulting Curator.\n\n![Murray Layout Photo](image:murray-layout-photo.jpg)\n\nThe present Botanic Gardens were laid out and the collection\ntransferred along with the original range of glasshouses. The only\nplant from the old Garden known to be in the collection today is a\nWeeping Ash tree which can be seen to the south of the main lawn.\n\n![Weeping Ash](image:weeping-ash.jpg)\n\nThe move was completed in 1842 and the Gardens then opened to members\nof the Royal Botanical lnstitution and their families for an annual\nsubscription of one guinea. Later the public were admitted on selected\ndays for the sum of one penny. Glasgow Corporation took over full\nownership of the Botanic gardens in 1891 and since that time the\ngrounds and glasshouses have opened daily free of charge to all\nvisitors.\n\nThe jewel in the crown of structures within the Gardens is undoubtedly\nthe Kibble Palace, by John Kibble.\n\nSome controversy surrounds the Kibble Palace as it became known, as\nSir Joseph Paxton was credited with its design and. as an engineer,\nJohn Kibble would have been familiar with Paxton's other work and his\nassociation with the Crystal Palace.\n\nJohn Kibble had the glasshouse built as a conservatory at his home in\nCoulport on Loch Long.\n\nKibble offered the structure to Glasgow for erection in Queen's Park,\nbut, when the city dithered, he withdrew his offer and it was moved to\nits present site in 1873, following an agreement between himself and\nthe Royal Botanic Institution. The agreement was to run for twenty one\nyears and involved an annual payment which became a serious burden to\nthe Institution within a few years. In 1881, as a result of a loan of\n£25,000 granted by the Corporation of Glasgow, the Institution was\nable to buy out the lease for £10,000.\n\nThe conservatory was dismantled at Coulport in May 1872 and brought to\nthe Gardens via Bowling on the lower reaches of the River Clyde, and\nup the Forth and Clyde Canal to Port Dundas. It was re-erected, with\nconsiderable extensions, by James Boyd and Sons of Paisley.\n\nIn 1874 the Kibble Crystal Art Palace and Conservatory as it was then\nknown, had 39 statues as advertised in Tweed's Guide to Glasgow of\n1874.\n\n![Kibble Palace in 1875](image:kibble-1875.jpg)\n\nThis image of the Kibble taken in 1875 shows the large hall erected\nfor John Kibbles oxy-hydrogen lantern performances.\n\n\nIt was entered from the central corridor. Kibbles' intention was to\nuse the building for concerts and public meetings, this continued for\nabout ten years during which time many large meetings took place. The\nAmerican Evangelists, Moody and Sankey, preached to a crowd of several\nthousand people outside the Kibble Palace. Both Benjamin Disraeli and\nWilliam Ewart Gladstone were installed as Lord Rectors of the\nUniversity of Glasgow in 1873 and 1879, and delivered their Rectorial\naddresses in the Kibble Palace.\n\n![Disraeli installed as Rector in 1873](image:disraeli-rector.jpg)\n\nFrom the 18801s the Kibble was planted up with temperate plants\nincluding an important collection of tree ferns from the southern\nhemisphere.\n\n![Kibble Ferns](image:kibble-ferns.jpg)\n\nTo this day John Kibble has been the only person to Bicycle across\nLoch Long on floats.\n\nIn 1875 an ornamental iron bandstand was erected on the lawn in front\nof the Main Range of Glasshouses.\n\n![Bandstand](image:bandstand.jpg)\n![Drawing of Bandstand in 1887](image:bandstand-1887.jpg)\n\nThe Band of Prince Albert's Light Infantry were first to perform here\non 4 August 1875. By 1912 a new pavilion style band-stand was\nconstructed on the site now occupied by the World Rose Garden. This\nwas used for military and local brass bands, and children's\nentertainment of the seaside type. These provided a moral boost during\nthe two World Wars but by the late 1950's they were attracting little\npublic interest. Sadly the bandstand was demolished in 1965.\n\nThe loan from the Corporation was also intended for the rebuilding of\nthe Main Range Glasshouses, which was by this time in a serious state\nof disrepair, having come from the old site. The new range of houses\nwas built on the same site and opened in early 1883.\n\nThe taking of this loan proved a fateful point of history of the\nInstitution. By 1885 the financial position had become critical, but\nrather than sell up the Gardens, the Institution wished to maintain\nwhat had been built up for the City and so made moves in favour of the\nCorporation taking over. On 1st April 1887 Glasgow Corporation entered\ninto possession as creditors and the Gardens were closed, maintenance\nwork continued at the Corporations expense.\n\nThe City of Glasgow Act 1891, provided that, 'the gardens and the\nproperty and effects of the Botanic Institution should be transferred\nto and vested in the Corporation, to be kept open, preserved and\nmaintained as a public area and botanic gardens for all time', and\nalso to continue the privileges of the University for the teaching of\nbotany. Thus the original intentions of the founders have been\nsafeguarded, and the position of the Gardens in the lie ofthe City has\nbeen maintained.\n\n![1890 map](image:1890map.jpg)\n\nThis 1890 map of the Botanic Gardens shows how the gardens extended\neast of the current Queen Margaret Drive into the neighbouring North\nPark Estate which originally belonged to John Hamilton, who was thrice\nLord Provost of the city.\n\n![North Park House](image:northparkhouse.jpg)\n\nNorth Park House (the former BBC Scotland Building) was purchased in\n1882 by Mrs Isabella Elder (1828- 1905) wife of the famous John Elder\none of the founder members of the Fairfield Shipyard in Govan. She had\nthe house converted in 1883 into a college for women named after Queen\nMargaret (1046-1093), the wife of Scottish King Malcolm Canmore King\nMalcolm Ill) (1031-1093).\n\nThe College was unique in Scotland as a Women's College that offered\nuniversity level teaching in both arts and medicine. In 1892 Queen\nMargaret College became part of the University of Glasgow and all\nteaching was transferred to Gilmorehill in 1935.  By the 1920's the\nnew Queen Margaret Drive and Bridge were constructed resulting in this\nsection of the gardens being lost\n"},{"id":5001,"title":"Cain (1899) or My Punishment is greater than I can bear","images":["![Cain by Edwin Roscoe Mullins, 1901](image:cain.jpg)"],"url":"contents/trail/kibble-statues/cain.md","metaData":{"containedBy":["5"],"index":["5001"],"tag":["statue","kibble:statue"]},"etag":"wNcOpP6tcgsMLeBO32AY_DgVVZGs473mGJlpk8w_tng=","text":"\nThe sculpture of Cain, son of Adam and Eve crouching in anguish at his\npunishment for jealously murdering his brother Abel\n([Genesis 4:13][2]) is the work of Edwin Roscoe Mullins (1848-1907).\nIt is made of marble on an octagonal brick base and has a height\n0f 99.5cm.\n\nThe sculpture was purchased from the Glasgow International Exhibition\nof 1901 at a cost of £300.
