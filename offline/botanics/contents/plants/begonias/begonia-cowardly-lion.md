# Begonia 'Cowardly Lion'

![Begonia Cowardly Lion](begonia-cowardly-lion.jpg)

B. 'Cowardly Lion' is a hybrid. It's a Kit Jeans Mounger cross, B. carrieae x B. _Bokit_.
Other crosses have been made, using Cowardly Lion as a parent.

The coloration of the leaves reminds you of the Cowardly Lion's fur in the Wizard of Oz.
It's a medium-sized rhizomatous begonia which is suitable for houseplant growth, as it doesn't grow too large.
