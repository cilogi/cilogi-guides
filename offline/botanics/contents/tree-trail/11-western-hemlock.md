# Western Hemlock

![Western Hemlock](western-hemlock.jpg)

<p class="species-info"><em>Tsuga heterophylla</em> Sarg</p>

Native range: The pacific region of North America: Alaska to California and areas around the Rocky Mountains
(British Columbia,Idaho and Montana)

The tree was introduced to Scotland in 1852 by John Jeffrey.

The name _heterophylla_ relates to the varying lengths of the needles (leaves). In Greek, hetero means ‘different’
  and _phylla_ means leaf.

The tree acquired the common name ‘hemlock’ from the parsley like smell of hemlock which the foliage gives off when
  crushed (True hemlock is a herb in the carrot family __Apiacaeae__)

A very fast growing tree used in timber production in the British Isles. Tsuga heterophylla is ecologically associated
  with the temperate rain forests of the Pacific Fog bank and is therefore ideal for the wetter climate found in the west
  of the British Isles.  Western Hemlock does not tolerate drought or exposure and can grow into a weak, multi-stemmed form
  if environmentally stressed.

The light reddish brown timber is used for plywood, framing timber and other construction purposes. Untreated timber
  is prone to decay and insect attack.

_Tsuga heterophylla_ has a IUCN conservation rating ‘Least Concern’
