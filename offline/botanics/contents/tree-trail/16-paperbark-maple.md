# Paperbark Maple

![Paperbark Maple](paperbark-maple.jpg)

<p class="species-info"><em>Acer griseum</em> Pax</p>

Native Range: Central China at altitudes of 1,500m to 2,000m.

It was introduced into horticulture in Britain in 1901 by [Ernest Henry Wilson](/wiki/Ernest_Henry_Wilson)
for Veitch Nurseries.

Acer griseum grows very well in gardens on the chalky soil of Southern England and can grow up to 45 feet high

The striking copper-brown bark peels to reveal the orange newer bark underneath. In autumn the bark compliments
the bright red, pink and orange of the leaves.

Horticulturalists are trying to widen the gene pool of the cultivated Acer griseum but this can prove problematic
as the seeds of the tree has only a 5% germination rate

The tree in front of you was planted in November 1984 and has fantastic autumn colour with the leaves turning a
brilliant red.
