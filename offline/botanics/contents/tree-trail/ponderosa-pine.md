<p class="species-info"><em>Pinus ponderosa</em></p>

Pinus ponderosa, commonly known as the ponderosa pine, bull pine, blackjack pine, or
western yellow pine, is a very large pine tree species of variable habitat native to the
western United States and Canada. It is the most widely distributed pine species in North America.

It grows in various erect forms from British Columbia southward and eastward through 16 western U.S.
states and has been successfully introduced in temperate regions of Europe. It was first seen and
collected in 1826 in eastern Washington near present-day Spokane. On that occasion, David Douglas
misidentified it as Pinus resinosa (red pine). In 1829, Douglas concluded that he had a new pine
among his specimens and coined the name Pinus ponderosa for its heavy wood. In 1836, it was formally
named and described by Charles Lawson, a Scottish nurseryman. It is the official state tree
of Montana.
