# Maidenhair fern

![Maidenhair fern](maidenhair-fern.jpg)

They are distinctive in appearance, with dark, often black stipes and rachises, and bright green,
often delicately cut leaf tissue. The sori are borne submarginally, and are covered by reflexed flaps
of leaf tissue which resemble indusia. Dimorphism between sterile and fertile fronds is generally subtle.

They generally prefer humus-rich, moist, well-drained sites, ranging from bottom-land soils to vertical rock walls.
Many species are especially known for growing on rock walls around waterfalls and water seepage areas.

The highest species diversity is in the Andes. Fairly high diversity also occurs in eastern Asia,
with nearly 40 species in China.

Species native to North America include A. pedatum (five-fingered fern) and the closely related _A. aleuticum_,
which are distinctive in having a bifurcating frond that radiates pinnae on one side only.
_A. capillus-veneris_ (Venus-hair fern) has a native distribution that extends into the eastern continent. _A. jordanii_
(California Maidenhair) is native to the west coast.

There is a rich _Adiantum_ flora in New Zealand with 3 endemic species (_A. cunninghamii_, _A. viridescens_ and _A. fulvum_)
in a total of 10 recorded species. Many of these are common especially in the west and south of the islands.
