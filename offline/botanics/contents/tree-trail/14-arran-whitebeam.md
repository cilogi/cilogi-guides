# Arran Whitebeam

![Arran Whitebeam](arran-whitebeam.jpg)

<p class="species-info"><em>Sorbus arranensis</em> Hedl</p>

Native Range: Island of Arran, Scotland.

This rare Scottish tree is endemic to Arran and is restricted in range to the north end of the island where it grows
in rocky steep sided glens between 100m to 300 m.

The earliest known description of the Arran Whitebeam is that of Alexander Craig Christie in 1869.

_Sorbus arranensis_ is believed have resulted from the rare crossing of _Sorbus aucuparia_ (Rowan) and _Sorbus rupicola_
(Rock Whitebeam). A unique clonal population (microspecies) then grew from the seeds of the hybrid.
This happens through a form of asexual (non-sexual) reproduction (agamospermy).

The species has been at the centre of conservation work along with another species the Arran Service Tree:
_Sorbus pseudofennica_. In 1954 a National Nature Reserve was set up to protect and manage the habitats growing around
the trees and in 1984 a trial population reinforcement programme was implemented. Work is still continuing on the
species at Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh as part of the Target 8 Project. The Target 8 Project is one of the targets
set out in the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation, which aims to conserve 75% of threatened native species in
cultivation. _Sorbus arranensis_ is one of theses threatened species due to habitat loss, severe weather and over grazing
by sheep and cattle. There is thought to be only around 500 plants left growing in the north of the Isle of Arran.
