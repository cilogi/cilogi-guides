# Sitka Spruce

![Sitka Spruce](sitka-spruce.jpg)

<p class="species-info"><em>Picea sitchensis</em> Carriere</p>

Native Range: North America. It thrives in the Pacific Fog Belt near the coast from Alaska to California.

The tree is named after [Sitka Island](/wiki/Sitka,_Alaska) in Alaska.

[Archibald Menzies](/wiki/Archibald_Menzies) described the species as growing in North America in 1792 
and the trees were introduced to Britain by [David Douglas](/wiki/David_Douglas_&#40;botanist&#41;) in 1831.

A moisture loving tree it grows very well in Scotland and is a very important commercial timber tree. The speed of
growth of the Sitka Spruce means it can reach its maximum timber potential in 40 years in comparison to an oak which
may take over 150 years.

In plantation forestry, Sitka Spruce can grow very close together forming a dense canopy. This shades out other plant
species but many birds such as Goshawks and Sparrowhawks can hunt and nest around Sitka Spruce stands. Crossbills
and Siskin can also be found feeding and nesting in the branches.

The thinned timber from plantations is used to make pulp for paper making while more mature trees are turned into
pallets, packing boxes and used in construction

More information on the extensive uses of this tree for its timber can be found on the
