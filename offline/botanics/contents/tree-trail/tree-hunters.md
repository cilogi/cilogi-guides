Since the 18th century Scottish botanists were scouring
the world for new plant species. Known as ‘Plant
Hunters’, these colourful characters explored the
furthest corners of the world in search of plants and
trees. They were real-life adventurers who returned
with intrepid tales, as well as precious and exotic plant
seeds.

The most famous Scottish Plant Hunters included
[Archibald Menzies](/wiki/Archibald_Menzies), [David Douglas](/wiki/David_Douglas_&#40;botanist&#41;),
[Thomas Drummond](/wiki/Thomas_Drummond_&#40;botanist&#41;)
and [John Jeffrey](/wiki/John_Jeffrey_&#40;botanist&#41;).

[David Douglas](/wiki/David_Douglas_&#40;botanist&#41;), who is immortalised by the [Douglas
Fir tree](/wiki/Douglas_fir), collected more than 240 species. He is also
famous for introducing the [Sitka Spruce](page:713), which is now
the mainstay of the UK’s commercial forestry. Discover
both trees on this __tree trail__.

Born in Scone in 1799, David Douglas had strong links
with Glasgow. He worked in Glasgow Botanic Gardens
in the early 1820s (he became the Head Gardener)
and attended botany lectures. His exciting life ended
in mysterious circumstances while collecting in Hawaii.
There is an area dedicated to David Douglas in the
Arboretum.

Plant hunters still exist today. They are conservationists
searching for and trying to save threatened trees such
as the [Moroccan Fir](page:718) and the [Arran Whitebeam](page:714). You
can see both on the Trail.
