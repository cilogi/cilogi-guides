# Monkey Puzzle

<p class="species-info"><em>Araucaria araucana</em> K Koch</p>


Native Range: Chile and Argentina, down both sides of the Andes with two small populations in Chile

The Chilean Pine was discovered by Spanish explorer Don Francisco Dendariaena in the 17th Century and introduced
to Britain by Archibald Menzies in 1795. He is said to have pocketed some Monkey Puzzle nuts from the dinner table
when his ships crew dined as guests of the governor of Chile. The seeds grew into five health saplings that were
eventually returned to Britain.

The tree derives its name from the Araucano indigenous people of Chile. They had traditionally used the tree seed
as an important seasonal food.

There are no monkeys in the native range of the tree.

The environment that the tree survives in is very dynamic and the effects of volcanoes, fire, landslides, snow
avalanche and high wind have led to some unusual adaptations. Unlike most conifers _Araucaria_ spp. can sprout from
cut stumps (epicormic buds)  or underground roots after being felled and it has very thick bark.

The tree is threatened by land use change, mining and quarrying and over exploitation as a cheap source of timber.

It is incredibly long lived tree with specimens over 1300 years old not uncommon.

The tree has an IUCN rating of ‘Endangered’
