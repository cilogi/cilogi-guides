<p class="species-info"><em>Pinus coulteri</em>  Don</p>

The Coulter pine or big-cone pine, Pinus coulteri, is a native of the coastal mountains
of Southern California and northern Baja California (Mexico). Isolated groves are found
as far north as the San Francisco Bay Area in Mt. Diablo State Park and Black Diamond Mines
Regional Preserve. The species is named after Thomas Coulter, an Irish botanist and physician.

The Coulter pine produces the largest cone of any pine tree. Although it has a limited range
in the wild, it is a popular ornamental tree.

The wood is weak and soft, so that the species is little used other than for firewood.
