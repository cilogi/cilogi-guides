# English Oak

![English Oak](english-oak.jpg)

<p class="species-info"><em>Quercus Robur</em>  L</p>

Native Range: Widespread throughout Europe, Russia and parts of Central Asia.

The tree is also called the French Oak or the Pedunculate Oak. The peduncle is
the long stalk that attaches the acorns to the branch. The other common oak in Britain,
the [Sessile Oak](/wiki/Quercus_petraea) (Quercus petrea) does not have this characteristic.

Acorns are not produced until the tree is 40 years old.
Peak production occurs between 80 and 120 years of age.
Oaks can shorten as they grow older, in order to prolong their lifespan.

The flowers of the oak are called _catkins_ which spread pollen.

‘Robur’ refers to the strength of the wood. Oak was used
as the primary construction material for the ships of the Royal Navy.
The official Navy song is still [Heart of Oak](/wiki/Heart_of_Oak).

Oak is still planted for forestry and produces a strong and durable timber that is used
in interior finishes and furniture.

Quercus robur supports the highest biodiversity of insect herbivores of any British plant
with more than 400 species living on it.

Although the trees are threatened by many diseases such as Acute Oak Decline and damage
 caused by insects such as the Oak Jewel Beetle (Agrilus biguttatus), Quercus robur
 has a conservation rating (IUCN) marked at ‘least concern’.

There are only a few oak trees in the main Gardens and in the arboretum but several mature specimens
can be found along the Kelvin walkway/cycleway.
