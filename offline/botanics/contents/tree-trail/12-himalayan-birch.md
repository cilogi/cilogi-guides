<p class="species-info"><em>Betula utilis</em> ssp jacquemontii  Ashburner & McAll</p>

Native Range: North India, Central and West Nepal

Introduced into horticulture in 1880 after first being described in 1841, the peeling bark of these trees is not
always dazzlingly white but can range from ochre-cream to light pinkish brown.

The sub-species name ‘jacquemontii’ is in memory of [Victor Jacquemont](/wiki/Victor_Jacquemont) (1801-1832). 
He was a French naturalist who was sent from the main French botanic garden, [Jardin Des Plantes](/wiki/Jardin_des_plantes), 
to gather specimens in India. He died, aged 31, in Bombay (Mumbai) from cholera.

The species name ‘utilis’ refers to the Latin word meaning ‘useful’. The local people exploit the tree for many different uses:

The bark is used as a form of paper, often for sacred texts; the wood is used in making agricultural tools, 
household utensils and fencing and the branches are often the only fuel wood available.

_Betula utilis_ ssp. jacquemontii grows with rhododendron and juniper in its native range and is threatened 
due to increased demand for firewood and overgrazing that is reducing regeneration.
