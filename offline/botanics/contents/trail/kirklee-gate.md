![Kirklee Station (c 1894) closed 1939 in 1968](images/kirklee-station-1968.jpg)

The photo above was taken in 1964, after the line was closed, and 25 years
after the station closed.

It was a two platform through station, with neat single
storey red sandstone buildings. Though the down
platform building was not particularly unusual, the up
platform building was supported at the rear on massive
rustic walls, with recessed arches and had a little semi-octagonal
porch at the east end. Kirklee Station closed
on 1st May 1939, and the line closed down in October
1964.The station was demolished in 1970.
