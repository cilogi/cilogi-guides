# Arboretum

![The Arboretum (1977)](image:arboretum.jpg)

The newest part of the garden was officially opened on 27 April 1977
when Parks Convener John McQueenie planted a
[Metasequoia glyptostroboides](/wiki/Metasequoia_glyptostroboides)
(Dawn Redwood Tree). The curator saw this as an opportunity to
establish a small but much needed arboretum.

An arboretum is a collection of trees which are grown for display,
educational or scientific purposes.

The arboretum contains examples of many trees introduced by
[David Douglas](/wiki/David_Douglas) (1799-1836), the
famous plant collector, who worked in the original Gardens in the
1820's.

Douglas played an important part in collecting and bringing various
North American plants to Britain. He introduced the
[Douglas Fir](/wiki/Douglas-fir), originally the _Oregon
Pine_ until it was renamed after him.
