## Arboretum

![The Arboretum (1977)](images/arboretum.jpg)

The newest part of the garden was officially opened on
27 April 1977 when Parks Convener John McQueenie
planted a [Metasequoia glyptostroboides](/wiki.html?target=Metasequoia_glyptostroboides) (Dawn
Redwood Tree). The curator saw this as an opportunity
to establish a small but much needed arboretum.

An arboretum is a collection of trees which are grown
for display, educational or scientific purposes.

The arboretum contains examples of many trees
introduced by [David Douglas](/wiki.html?target=David_Douglas) (1799-1836). the
famous plant collector, who worked in the original
Gardens in the 1820's.

He played an important part in collecting and bringing
various North American plants to Britain. He
introduced the [Douglas Fir](/wiki.html?target=Douglas-fir), originally the Oregon Pine
until it was renamed after him.
