# Main Gates and East and West Lodges

![Main Gates](image:main-gates.jpg)

The entrance and lodges were constructed in 1894 by
the City Architect Alex B McDonald (1847 - 1915) and
all are Category B Listed.

The gateway of 4 symmetrical columns is comprised of
alternating bands of red brick and sandstone which rise
into a curved and moulded stone cope. The two
innermost gate-piers are topped with decorative
wrought iron lamp brackets. The gates and pillars were
moved back nearer to the lodges from their original
position in the 1920's when the new Queen Margaret
Drive and Bridge were constructed.

The Lodges of mock Tudor style flank the main
entrance to the Gardens. Both are single storey with
symmetrical inward facing elevations and face onto
Great Western Road. The steps to the door have an
ashlar parapet supporting a gabled porch on Roman
Doric columns. The porches are flanked by mullioned
and transomed 3 light window and roll-moulded
panels on the West lodge containing the Glasgow City
crest while the East lodge has the date 1894.
