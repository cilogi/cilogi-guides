The 'B' listed Curators House was built in 1840, and is still known by
this name. Designed by [Charles Wilson][1], a central figure in the
development of Glasgow's architecture and town planning in the mid
19th century, the house is an asymmetrical 2-storey villa with single
storey wing and conservatory to the west standing in its own fenced
garden.

Two of the ground floor rooms are currently used for interpretative
displays and art exhibitions. the other rooms form part of the
Gardens' Library and Herbarium.  Members of staff, apprentices and
visiting professional botanists and horticulturists are welcome to use
the library on request.

[Charles Wilson][1] is buried in the [Southern Necropolis][2] and his
Obelisk is a feature of the [Southern Necropolis Heritage Trail][3].
