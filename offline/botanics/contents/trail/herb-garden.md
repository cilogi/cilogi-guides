![Herb Garden](image:herb-garden.jpg)

The original Herb Garden, laid out in 1957, was adjacent to the Kibble
Palace; the plants were lifted and relocated to their new site around
2000 in preparation for work to restore the Kibble Palace. The garden
consists of five beds which are planted with -- Scented herbs, Dye
plants, Culinary plants, Medicinal plants and in the centre of the
lawn is the Scottish bed with plants that were used historically
within Scotland such as Yellow Flag (Iris pseudacorus) a traditional
Scottish dye plant.
