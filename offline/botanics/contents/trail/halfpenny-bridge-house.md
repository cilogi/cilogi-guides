# Halfpenny Bridge House

![Halfpenny Bridge House](image:halfpenny-bridge-house.jpg)

This is a single-storey red brick building with pitched
slate tiled roof. It was originally used as an old man's
shelter but is now leased to the Friends of the River
Kelvin [FORK). This group of people who care
passionately about the River and its wildlife set up the
Friends group in 1991. Their aim is to heighten and
extend public awareness and commitment to the care
and maintenance of the Kelvin and its tributaries.
