# North Woodside Flint Mill

![North Woodside Flint Mill, pre 1765](images/north-woodside-flint-mill.jpg)

Although its origins are unclear, the North Woodside
Mill was erected by Archibald Stirling of Keir, owner of
the North Woodside Estate. It was well established as a
grain mill in 1765 and was also used to grind
gunpowder during the Napoleonic wars. The mill was
converted, to grind flints by the owner of the [Verreville
Pottery][1] in Glasgow, in the middle of the nineteenth
century. The flints were first calcined (burnt) in the kiln
on the same site. Verreville Pottery closed in 1917 but a
firm from Paisley kept the North Woodside Mill working.
The mill continued to operate until the late 1950's and
soon after closure the buildings were partially
demolished.

The most substantial survivals are the square tapering
kiln of stone and brick. concrete, and the weir and lade.
