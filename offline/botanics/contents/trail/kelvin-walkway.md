# Kelvin Walkway

![The Kelvin Walkway](image:kelvin-walkway.jpg)

The wooded banks and grassy slopes of the River
Kelvin have long been admired for their beauty and the
idea of a walkway along the river's edge was discussed
as long ago as 1890 and again in the 1950s.

Today this walkway is a reality which offers very pleasant
and picturesque surroundings. It links Kelvingrove Park
with the Botanic Gardens and now connects up with the
West Highland Way. It also fonns part of the Glasgow to
Milngavie cycle route. One of the most popular sections
of the walkway runs through the northern section of the
Botanic Gardens.
