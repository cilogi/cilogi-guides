# Main Range of Glasshouses (1883)

![The Victorian Glasshouses](images/main-range.jpg)

These Victorian Glasshouses were originally built in
Burma teak in the early 1880s and house a wide range
of tropical plants, including orchids, ferns, cacti and
succulents, palms, begonias, plants used in commerce
and aquatics. A phased restoration of this 'B' listed
building began with the palm house in 1988 using steel
and aluminium, followed by the remaining houses with
the west wing completing the restoration to its original
design in 2004. In 2005 the City Council installed a
memorial to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen
Mother in the west wing.
