The Kirklee Bridge was built during 1899 - 1900 for
Glasgow Corporation Highways Department by
Foreman & McColl Engineers. It consists of a high
semi-elliptical masonry span with narrow semicircular
arches on each side.

The main span is flanked by pairs of granite Ionic
columns, and there are low-relief carvings of the arms
of Glasgow in the spandrels.
