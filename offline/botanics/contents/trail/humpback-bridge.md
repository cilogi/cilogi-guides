# Humpback Bridge (1908)

![Humpback Bridge, 1908](image:humpback-bridge.jpg)

The 'B' Listed cast iron Humpback Bridge, which spans
the Kelvin from the Walkway to the north eastern corner
of the Gardens was built in 1908 by Messrs Orr, Watt &
Co ltd of Motherwell. It replaced a short lived 'rustic'
bridge which was built in the 1890's.

Once you have crossed the Humpback Bridge ascend
the stairs which will take you back to the main gardens
where you will find public toilets, baby changing
facilities and refreshments.
