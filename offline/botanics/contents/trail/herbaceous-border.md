## The Herbaceous Border

![Herbaceous Border](images/herbaceous-border.jpg)

These delightful borders form another of the Gardens traditional
horticultural features. Divided into two sections by the centre path,
the southern border is backed by a small clipped beech hedge whilst
the south facing herbaceous border is backed by a 3m high beech hedge.
