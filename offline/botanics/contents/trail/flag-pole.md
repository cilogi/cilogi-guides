## Flag Pole

![Flag Pole](images/flag-pole.jpg)

When the original Douglas fir flagpole failed its replacement was
selected and stored, but when work began to craft it, it was found to
be rotten. The current flagpole and weather vane which marks the
highest part of the gardens dates from 1991 and is a metal street
lighting pole fitted with guys to create the illusion of a traditional
timber pole.
