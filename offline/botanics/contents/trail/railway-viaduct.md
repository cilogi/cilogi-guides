The viaducts at Garrioch Quadrant were built circa 1896 for
the Glasgow Central and Lanarkshire &
Dumbartonshire Railways. The eastern viaduct (GCR)
has three large semicircular arches, in rustic masonry,
with a small arch for a footpath on each side, while the
western (L&DR) has plate girders on rustic masonry
piers.
