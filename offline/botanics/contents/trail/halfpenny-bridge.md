# Halfpenny Bridge

![Halfpenny Bridge](image:halfpenny-bridge.jpg)

Built around 1886, the original foot-bridge was a
wrought iron box girder bridge. There was a toll to cross
charged by the owner of old Kelvinside House set at
one half penny hence its name 'The Ha'penny Bridge'.
The bridge was washed away on the 1Oth December
1994. Glasgow City Council decided to replace the lost
bridge with a wooden one as a vital link in its Glasgow to
Milngavie cycle route. Built in Holland and costing
Â£200,000 the bridge was opened in 2004.
