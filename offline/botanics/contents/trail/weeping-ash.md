![Leaves of the Weeping Ash](image:weeping-ash-leaves.jpg)

The Weeping Ash tree (Fraxinus excelsior 'Pendula')
adjacent to the Main Lawn is known to have been
transplanted from the Botanic Garden at Sandyford in
1841. It had been given in 1818 by Robert Austin, a
nurseryman, and one of the original directors.
