# The Elf (1899)

![The Elf by William Goscombe John, 1899](image:the-elf.jpg)

Welsh sculptor [William Goscombe John](/wiki/Goscombe_John) (1860-1952) regarded the 'Elf' as
one of his greatest achievements.  This stood in Kelvingrove Art
Galleries from 1901 to the 1930s when it moved to its current setting.

The statue is made of marble and is 1.04m high. It is a marble copy of
a bronze original, copies of which are in the National Museum of
Wales, Cardiff and the RA Diploma Collections.

The plaster model was shown at the RA exhibition of 1898, and then
Paris, Rome and Venice.  This version was shown at the RA in 1899 and
at the [Glasgow International Exhibition of 1901](/wiki/Glasgow_International_Exhibition_&#40;1901&#41;)
where it was purchased by the City for Â£525.

The work was much prized by John and is carved in relief on the
wooden base of his self portrait of 1942, which is in the National
Museum of Wales.
