King Robert of Sicily

_Henry Wadsworth Longfellow_ _(1807–1882)_

ROBERT of Sicily, brother of Pope Urbane<br/>
And Valmond, emperor of Allemaine,<br/>
Apparelled in magnificent attire,<br/>
With retinue of many a knight and squire,<br/>
On Saint John’s eve, at vespers, proudly sat<br/>
And heard the priests chant the Magnificat.<br/>
And as he listened o’er and o’er again<br/>
Repeated, like a burden or refrain,<br/>
He caught the words, “Deposuit potentes<br/>
De sede, et exaltavit humiles;”<br/>
And slowly lifting up his kingly head,<br/>
He to a learnèd clerk beside him said,<br/>
“What mean these words?” The clerk made answer meet,<br/>
“He has put down the mighty from their seat,<br/>
And has exalted them of low degree.”<br/>
Thereat King Robert muttered scornfully,<br/>
“’Tis well that such seditious words are sung<br/>
Only by priests and in the Latin tongue;<br/>
For unto priests and people be it known,<br/>
There is no power can push me from my throne!”<br/>
And leaning back, he yawned and fell asleep,<br/>
Lulled by the chant monotonous and deep.<br/>

When he awoke, it was already night;<br/>
The church was empty, and there was no light,<br/>
Save where the lamps that glimmered, few and faint,<br/>
Lighted a little space before some saint.<br/>
He started from his seat and gazed around,<br/>
But saw no living thing and heard no sound.<br/>
He gropèd towards the door, but it was locked;<br/>
He cried aloud, and listened, and then knocked,<br/>
And uttered awful threatenings and complaints,<br/>
And imprecations upon men and saints.<br/>
The sounds reëchoed from the roof and walls<br/>
As if dead priests were laughing in their stalls.<br/>

At length the sexton, hearing from without<br/>
The tumult of the knocking and the shout,<br/>
And thinking thieves were in the house of prayer,<br/>
Came with his lantern, asking, “Who is there?”<br/>
Half choked with rage, King Robert fiercely said,<br/>
“Open: ’tis I, the king! Art thou afraid?”<br/>
The frightened sexton, muttering, with a curse,<br/>
“This is some drunken vagabond, or worse!”<br/>
Turned the great key and flung the portal wide;<br/>
A man rushed by him at a single stride,<br/>
Haggard, half naked, without hat or cloak,<br/>
Who neither turned, nor looked at him, nor spoke.<br/>
But leaped into the blackness of the night,<br/>
And vanished like a spectre from his sight.<br/>

Robert of Sicily, brother of Pope Urbane<br/>
And Valmond, emperor of Allemaine,<br/>
Despoiled of his magnificent attire,<br/>
Bare-headed, breathless, and besprent with mire,<br/>
With sense of wrong and outrage desperate,<br/>
Strode on and thundered at the palace gate:<br/>
Rushed through the court-yard, thrusting in his rage<br/>
To right and left each seneschal and page,<br/>
And hurried up the broad and sounding stair,<br/>
His white face ghastly in the torches’ glare.<br/>
From hall to hall he passed with breathless speed:<br/>
Voices and cries he heard, but did not heed,<br/>
Until at last he reached the banquet-room,<br/>
Blazing with light, and breathing with perfume.<br/>

There on the dais sat another king,<br/>
Wearing his robes, his crown, his signet-ring,<br/>
King Robert’s self in features, form, and height,<br/>
But all transfigured with angelic light!<br/>
It was an angel; and his presence there<br/>
With a divine effulgence filled the air,<br/>
An exaltation, piercing the disguise,<br/>
Though none the hidden angel recognize.<br/>

A moment speechless, motionless, amazed,<br/>
The throneless monarch on the angel gazed,<br/>
Who met his looks of anger and surprise<br/>
With the divine compassion of his eyes;<br/>
Then said, “Who art thou? and why com’st thou here?”<br/>
To which King Robert answered with a sneer,<br/>
“I am the king, and come to claim my own<br/>
From an impostor, who usurps my throne!”<br/>
And suddenly, at these audacious words,<br/>
Up sprang the angry guests, and drew their swords;<br/>
The angel answered with unruffled brow,<br/>
“Nay, not the king, but the king’s jester; thou<br/>
Henceforth shalt wear the bells and scalloped cape,<br/>
And for thy counsellor shalt lead an ape:<br/>
Thou shalt obey my servants when they call,<br/>
And wait upon my henchmen in the hall!”<br/>

Deaf to King Robert’s threats and cries and prayers,<br/>
They thrust him from the hall and down the stairs;<br/>
A group of tittering pages ran before,<br/>
And as they opened wide the folding-door,<br/>
His heart failed, for he heard, with strange alarms,<br/>
The boisterous laughter of the men-at-arms,<br/>
And all the vaulted chamber roar and ring<br/>
With the mock plaudits of “Long live the king!”<br/>

Next morning, waking with the day’s first beam,<br/>
He said within himself, “It was a dream!”<br/>
But the straw rustled as he turned his head,<br/>
There were the cap and bells beside his bed;<br/>
Around him rose the bare, discolored walls,<br/>
Close by, the steeds were champing in their stalls,<br/>
And in the corner, a revolting shape,<br/>
Shivering and chattering, sat the wretched ape.<br/>
It was no dream; the world he loved so much<br/>
Had turned to dust and ashes at his touch!<br/>

Days came and went; and now returned again<br/>
To Sicily the old Saturnian reign;<br/>
Under the angel’s governance benign<br/>
The happy island danced with corn and wine,<br/>
And deep within the mountain’s burning breast<br/>
Enceladus, the giant, was at rest.<br/>

Meanwhile King Robert yielded to his fate,<br/>
Sullen and silent and disconsolate.<br/>
Dressed in the motley garb that jesters wear,<br/>
With looks bewildered and a vacant stare,<br/>
Close shaven above the ears, as monks are shorn,<br/>
By courtiers mocked, by pages laughed to scorn,<br/>
His only friend the ape, his only food<br/>
What others left,—he still was unsubdued.<br/>
And when the angel met him on his way,<br/>
And half in earnest, half in jest, would say,<br/>
Sternly, though tenderly, that he might feel<br/>
The velvet scabbard held a sword of steel,<br/>
“Art thou the king?” the passion of his woe<br/>
Burst from him in resistless overflow,<br/>
And lifting high his forehead, he would fling<br/>
The haughty answer back, “I am, I am the king!”<br/>

Almost three years were ended; when there came<br/>
Ambassadors of great repute and name<br/>
From Valmond, emperor of Allemaine,<br/>
Unto King Robert, saying that Pope Urbane<br/>
By letter summoned them forthwith to come<br/>
On Holy Thursday to his city of Rome.<br/>
The angel with great joy received his guests,<br/>
And gave them presents of embroidered vests,<br/>
And velvet mantles with rich ermine lined,<br/>
And rings and jewels of the rarest kind.<br/>
Then he departed with them o’er the sea<br/>
Into the lovely land of Italy,<br/>
Whose loveliness was more resplendent made<br/>
By the mere passing of that cavalcade,<br/>
With plumes, and cloaks, and housings, and the stir<br/>
Of jewelled bridle and of golden spur.<br/>
And lo! among the menials, in mock state,<br/>
Upon a piebald steed, with shambling gait,<br/>
His cloak of fox-tails flapping in the wind,<br/>
The solemn ape demurely perched behind,<br/>
King Robert rode, making huge merriment<br/>
In all the country towns through which they went.<br/>

The pope received them with great pomp, and blare<br/>
Of bannered trumpets, on Saint Peter’s square,<br/>
Giving his benediction and embrace,<br/>
Fervent, and full of apostolic grace.<br/>
While with congratulations and with prayers<br/>
He entertained the angel unawares,<br/>
Robert, the jester, bursting through the crowd,<br/>
Into their presence rushed, and cried aloud:<br/>
“I am the king! Look and behold in me<br/>
Robert, your brother, king of Sicily!<br/>
This man, who wears my semblance to your eyes,<br/>
Is an impostor in a king’s disguise.<br/>
Do you not know me? does no voice within<br/>
Answer my cry, and say we are akin?”<br/>
The pope in silence, but with troubled mien,<br/>
Gazed at the angel’s countenance serene;<br/>
The emperor, laughing, said, “It is strange sport<br/>
To keep a madman for thy fool at court!”<br/>
And the poor, baffled jester in disgrace<br/>
Was hustled back among the populace.<br/>

In solemn state the holy week went by,<br/>
And Easter Sunday gleamed upon the sky;<br/>
The presence of an angel, with its light,<br/>
Before the sun rose, made the city bright,<br/>
And with new fervor filled the hearts of men,<br/>
Who felt that Christ indeed had risen again.<br/>
Even the jester, on his bed of straw,<br/>
With haggard eyes the unwonted splendor saw;<br/>
He felt within a power unfelt before,<br/>
And, kneeling humbly on his chamber floor,<br/>
He heard the rustling garments of the Lord<br/>
Sweep through the silent air, ascending heavenward.<br/>

And now the visit ending, and once more<br/>
Valmond returning to the Danube’s shore,<br/>
Homeward the angel journeyed, and again<br/>
The land was made resplendent with his train,<br/>
Flashing along the towns of Italy<br/>
Unto Salerno, and from there by sea.<br/>
And when once more within Palermo’s wall,<br/>
And, seated on his throne in his great hall,<br/>
He heard the Angelus from convent towers,<br/>
As if the better world conversed with ours,<br/>
He beckoned to King Robert to draw nigher,<br/>
And with a gesture bade the rest retire;<br/>
And when they were alone, the angel said,<br/>
“Art thou the king?” Then bowing down his head,<br/>
King Robert crossed both hands upon his breast,<br/>
And meekly answered him: “Thou knowest best!<br/>
My sins as scarlet are; let me go hence,<br/>
And in some cloister’s school of penitence,<br/>
Across those stones that pave the way to heaven<br/>
Walk barefoot till my guilty soul is shriven!”<br/>

The angel smiled, and from his radiant face<br/>
A holy light illumined all the place,<br/>
And through the open window, loud and clear,<br/>
They heard the monks chant in the chapel near,<br/>
Above the stir and tumult of the street:<br/>
“He has put down the mighty from their seat,<br/>
And has exalted them of low degree!”<br/>
And through the chant a second melody<br/>
Rose like the throbbing of a single string:<br/>
“I am an angel, and thou art the king!”<br/>

King Robert, who was standing near the throne,<br/>
Lifted his eyes, and lo! he was alone!<br/>
But all apparelled as in days of old,<br/>
With ermined mantle and with cloth of gold;<br/>
And when his courtiers came they found him there<br/>
Kneeling upon the floor, absorbed in silent prayer.<br/>
