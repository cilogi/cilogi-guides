The sculpture of Cain, son of Adam and Eve crouching in anguish at his

of 1901 at a cost of £300.  A plaster model was exhibited at the New
Gallery London in 1896.

#### About Mullins

Mullins was born in Holborn, London. He was the son of Edward Mullins
(born c.1808 in Box, Wiltshire), a solicitor and notary
public. Mullins died in 1907 at Shirley, Walberswick, Suffolk.

Mullins studied at Lambeth School of Art, the Royal Academy Schools,
and in the workshop of [John Birnie Philip][1]. Between 1866 and 1874 he
studied under [Professor Michael Wagmüller][3] at Munich, where he shared a studio
with Edward Onslow Ford. Mullins was awarded a silver medal at Munich
and a bronze medal at Vienna for a group entitled 'Sympathy' exhibited
in 1872. He suffered from poor health in the last decade or so of his
life which limited his ability to work. Cain was one of his last
works.
