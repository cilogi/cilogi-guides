# Ruth (c1880)

![Ruth by Giovanni Ciniselli, c1880](image:ruth.jpg)

[Ruth](/wiki/Ruth_&#40;biblical_figure&#41;), traditionally said to be an ancestor of Christ, is sculpted
by Milanese sculptor Giovanni Cinselli (1832-1883) who specialised in
portraits of Biblical and mythological figures.

[Ruth](wiki/Book_of_Ruth) is shown sitting on a tree stump with corn sheaves in her
left hand. These symbolize the harvesting of the corn in her future
huband, [Boaz's](/wiki/Boaz) field.

The book of Ruth contains the following well known verses, from Ruth 1:16-17

> And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return 
from following after thee: for whither thou goest, 
I will go; and where thou lodgest, I will lodge: 
thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God:

> Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: 
the Lord do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and me.

There is a popular song [Whither Thou Goest](/wiki/Whither_Thou_Goest) which
was often performed live by Leonard Cohen.
        
Ruth is mentioned in one of Keats' most famous poems, [_Ode to a
Nightingale_](http://www.online-literature.com/keats/479/).

> Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!<br/>
No hungry generations tread thee down;<br/>
The voice I hear this passing night was heard<br/>
In ancient days by emperor and clown:<br/>
Perhaps the selfsame song that found a path<br/>
Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home,<br/>
She stood in tears amid the alien corn;<br/>
The same that oft-times hath<br/>
Charmed magic casements, opening on the foam<br/>
Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.

The statue is carved in white marble on a dark plinth.  It was loaned
for the Kelvingrove International Exhibition of 1888 by Leonard
Gow and presented to the City by his family in 1927.
