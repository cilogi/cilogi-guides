# Ruth (c1880)

![Ruth by Giovanni Ciniselli, c1880](images/ruth.jpg)

[Ruth][1], traditionally said to be an ancestor of Christ, is sculpted
by Milanese sculptor Giovanni Cinselli (1832-1883) who specialised in
portraits of Biblical and mythological figures.

[Ruth][1] is shown sitting on a tree stump with corn sheaves in her
left hand. These symbolize the harvesting of the corn in her future
huband, Boaz's field.

Ruth is mentioned in one of Keats' most famous poems, [_Ode to a
Nightingale_][2].

> Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!<br/>
No hungry generations tread thee down;<br/>
The voice I hear this passing night was heard<br/>
In ancient days by emperor and clown:<br/>
Perhaps the selfsame song that found a path<br/>
Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home,<br/>
She stood in tears amid the alien corn;<br/>
The same that oft-times hath<br/>
Charmed magic casements, opening on the foam<br/>
Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.

The statue is carved in white marble on a dark plinth.  It was loaned
for the 1888 Kelvingrove International Exhibition of 1888 by Leonard
Gow and presented to the City by his family in 1927.
