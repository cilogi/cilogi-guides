# The sisters of Bethany (1871)

![The Sisters of Bethany by John Warrington Wood, 1871](image:sisters-of-bethany.jpg)

The subtitle is _The Master is come and calleth for Thee_.  The
subject is from the [Gospel of John (12, 1-7)][1] where Martha serves
supper to Christ and Lazarus and Mary anoints Christ's feet with
[Spikenard] and then wipes his feet with her hair.  Bethany is the
name of the village.

The statue was exhibited at the RA in 1979.  It was presented to
Glasgow Museums in 1936 by Dr Douglas White of Overtoun.

John Warrington Wood (1839-1886) was born in Warrington, as John
Wood. He studied at the town's School of Art, assuming the name of his
birthplace to distinguish himself from other students called John
Wood.

In 1865 Wood went to Rome and established a highly successful
practice, chiefly creating portrait busts and ideal works on sacred
themes. He was able to purchase the Villa Campana, near the church of
San Giovanni in Laterano in Rome where he operated an open house
policy to visitors and other artists. Wood also paid regular visits to
London and his house in Sloane Street.

In 1877 he was elected to the Guild of St Luke in Rome, a singular
honour for a foreign artist. Wood died suddenly of complications of a
heart condition at his apartments in the Lion Hotel in Bridge Street,
Warrington.
