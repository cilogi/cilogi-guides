# Botanic Gardens Station (Disused)

![Botanic Gardens Station (disused)](image:botanics-station.jpg)

The Botanic Gardens Station, which had been located
on Great Western Road was built in c1894 for the
Glasgow Central Railway and designed by the Scottish
architect, James Miller (1860-1947) the staff architect
for the Caledonian Railway Company. An unusual and
attractive station, it had the platforms and waiting rooms
underground as the railway ran mostly underground
from Stobcross Junction (now the Exhibition Centre)
up the valley of the River Kelvin to Maryhill.


The booking office was in a red brick building with a
steeply pitched roof having two towers with galleries,
surmounted by gilded onion domes. The centre portion
of the frontage was a veranda and there were pavilions
at either end. Botanic Gardens Station was the first to be
closed on 6th February 1939. The entire line was finally
closed down on the 5th October 1964 after just 68
years.

The booking office remained on Great Western Road
long after the station was closed and briefly became a
nightclub called Sergeant Peppers from 1967 until it
was destroyed by fire in 1970.

Here is a recent video of the interior of the station.
