# Old Queen Margaret Bridge

![Remains of the Old Queen Margaret Bridge](old-queen-margaret-bridge.jpg)
The first Queen Margaret Bridge was built in 1870 to
carry Queen Margaret Road over the River Kelvin. It was
constructed of two lattice girder spans carried on tall
rustic masonry piers. It was demolished in 1971. The
bases of the piers are still in place.
