This is an 'A' listed 19th century, curvilinear iron
structure of exquisite design and form. Originally
owned by John Kibble, an engineer with wide interests
and some eccentricities, his private conservatory was
moved to its present site in 1873. The main
conservatory: 150ft (46m) in diameter, is spanned by a
saucer-shaped dome with cupola.


The Kibble Palace was closed in 2003 in advance of a
multimillion pound restoration. This was completed in
2006 and the glasshouse re-opened to the public on St
Andrews day that year.
