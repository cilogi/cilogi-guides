The Kibble Palace is a 19th century iron and glass structure of
exquisite design and form. The building was originally owned by John Kibble, 
an engineer with wide interests and some eccentricities. 

Kibble's glasshouse was moved here in 1873. The main conservatory, 
46m in diameter, is spanned by a saucer-shaped dome with a cupola.

The Kibble Palace was closed in 2003 for a multimillion-pound
restoration. The restoration was completed in 2006 and the glasshouse re-opened to
the public on St. Andrew's day.
