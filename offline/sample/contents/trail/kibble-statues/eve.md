# Eve (c1880)

![Eve by Scipione Tadolini, c1880](image:eve.jpg)

This marble statue of Eve, the first woman, was created
by Italian sculptor Scipione Tadolini (1822-1892). This
remarkable artwork is the centrepiece of the Kibble
Palace.

On the pedestal are reliefs. The front shows _The First Family_.  The
rear shows _The Expulsion from the Garden_.

The statue is based on a plaster model in the [Palazzo Braschi][1],
Rome.  It was presented to Glasgow Museums in 1936 by Dr. Douglas
White of Overtoun.

A signed copy of Eve was sold at auction by Sotheby's for Â£49,250
in 2011.
