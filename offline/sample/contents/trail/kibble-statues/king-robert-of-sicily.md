# King Robert of Sicily (c1927)

![King Robert of Sicily by George Henry Paulin, c1927](image:king-robert-of-sicily.jpg)

The seated statue of King Robert and his monkey, executed by the
Scottish sculptor George Henry Paulin (1888-1962). King Robert is
sitting on a Jester's costume.  The statue is made of marble and
is 1.14 meters high. It was purchased in 1927 and exhibited at the RSA
in the same year.

King Robert of Sicily is a character in a well-known medieval poem,
_Roberd of Cisyle_, extant from the late 14th Century.
[Longfellow](/wiki/Henry_Wadsworth_Longfellow) wrote a poem based on
this in 1863 which we reproduce
[here](king-robert-of-sicily-longfellow.html).
