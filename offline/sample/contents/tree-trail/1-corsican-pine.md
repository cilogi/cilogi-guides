# Corsican Pine

![Corsican Pine](image:corsican-pine.jpg)

<p class="species-info"><em>Pinus nigra</em> subsp <em>laricio</em> Maire</p>

Native Range: From Sicily, Corsica and southern mainland Italy, westwards through Southern Europe.

Introduced into the British Isles as a tree for forestry and parkland in 1759.

A commercially important tree but problems with a disease called ‘Red Band Needle Blight’ have led to a
  decline in the numbers being planted.

Corsican Pine plantations are known to support a high number of invertebrate species, beetles and hoverflies.
  The Bordered White Moth (Bupalus piniana L.) is particularly associated with Corsican Pine in the British Isles.

_Pinus nigra_ is considered an invasive species in New Zealand where plantation trees have seeded into surrounding
  habitats shading out native grasses and plants.

Glasgow Botanic Gardens has a large and varied collection of pines from around the world such as
_Pinus wallichiana_ (Bhutan Pine) which grows wild across the Himalayas. It is sometimes
used to produce turpentine.

There is a pine collection in the arboretum with lots of interesting specimens including
_Pinus coulteri_
native to California and _Pinus ponderosa_] (Western Yellow Pine) collected by
David Douglas in 1826 in eastern Washington State.
