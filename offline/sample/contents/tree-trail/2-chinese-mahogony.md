<p class="species-info"><em>Toona sinensis</em> (Juss) M Roen</p>

Native Range: Eastern and south-eastern Asia. From North Korea, China, Nepal, Thailand, Malaysia
through toWestern Indonesia.

Introduced into parks and gardens in the British Isles in 1862.

The fruit, bark and leaves are used in traditional Chinese medicine, with young leaves being used as a
  salad crop in China.

Extracts from the leaves of _Toona sinensis_ have shown potential in the treatment of prostate cancer.

The timber is used for making the bodies of electric guitars and is used as a substitute for the three
  _Swietenia_ spp. (True Mahogany); timber is commercially restricted for conservation reasons.

The young shoots are cooked as a vegetable.  The leaves, when crushed, produce a scent similar to that of leeks.

_Toona sinensis_ is one of six species of trees in this genus and they can be found growing across Asia and Australia.
This species is fairly hardy but slow growing; the tree in front of you is thought to be one of the largest in
the United Kingdom, known as a Champion Tree. You can find more information about champion trees of
Britain and Ireland at [the tree register](www.treeregister.org/champion-trees.shtm).
