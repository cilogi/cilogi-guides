The inside of the triangular stalk was cut or\npeeled into long strips.  These strips were then laid out in two\nlayers, one horizontal and one vertical, one pressed and dried to form\na papyrus sheet.\n\nMany of the sheets were then joined end-to-end to form a roll. No glue\nwas required; instead, the natural gum of the plant held the sheets\ntogether. A roll was usually about one foot in height and could be up\nto 100 feet in length.\n\nBesides its use for producing a medium for writing purposes, papyrus\nwas also used for mattresses on beds, for building chairs, tables, and\nother furniture as well as for mats, baskets, boxes, sandals,\nutensils, rope and boats.  Furthermore, the papyrus root was a source\nof food, medicine and perfume.\n\nPapyrus was ancient Egypt's greatest export and it revolutionized the\nway people kept valuable information.  No substitution for papyrus\npaper could be found that was as durable and lightweight until the\ndevelopment of pulped paper by the Arabs.  Pulped paper was far easier\nto produce but not as durable.  This not only led to a decline in\npapyrus paper making, but also to a decline in the papyrus plant\ncultivation.  Eventually, the papyrus plant disappeared from the area\nof the Nile, where it was once the lifeblood of ancient Egypt.\n\nMore on [Wikipedia](/wiki.html?target=Papyrus)."}
