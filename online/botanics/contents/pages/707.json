The peduncle is\n the long stalk that attaches the acorns to the branch. The other common oak in Britain, the Sessile Oak (Quercus petrea) does not have this characteristic.\n\n‘Robur’ refers to strength in relation to the timber. Historically, oak was used\n  as the main construction material for the ships of the Royal Navy. Oak is still planted for forestry and produces a strong and durable timber that is used in interior finishes and furniture.\n\nQuercus robur supports the highest biodiversity of insect herbivores of any British plant\n  with more than 400 species living on it.\n\nAlthough the trees are threatened by many diseases such as Acute Oak Decline and damage\n  caused by insects such as the Oak Jewel Beetle (Agrilus biguttatus), Quercus robur\n  has a conservation rating (IUCN) marked at ‘least concern’.\n\nThere are only a few oak trees in the main Gardens and in the arboretum but several mature specimens\ncan be found along the Kelvin walkway/cycleway.\n\n__Below are some diagrams and a description that\nshould help you find more oak trees along the river:__"}
