It is thought to be\n  pollution tolerant in cities and salt tolerant in coastal areas.\n\nCommonly known as a sycamore throughout the British Isles it is alternatively called the ‘Plane Tree’ in Scotland.\n  This can cause confusion as the true plane trees belong to a separate genus (_Platanus_ spp.)\n\nSycamores or Scot’s Plane trees were widely associated with the French connections of Mary Queen of Scots (1542-1587).\n  A tree planted by Mary at Scone Palace stood till 1941, when it fell in a storm\n\nSycamore leaves can often be affected by tar spot fungus which causes yellow spots on the leaves.\n  The spots turn black later in the year but this does little damage to the tree\n\nThe timber is white, easily worked and was used for wood panelling and violin manufacture\n\nWhilst identification in the growing season of this plant can be easy, it may be come more difficult in the winter when\nit can be confused with Acer platanoides (Norway maple). The way to tell these to species apart is by a couple of key\ndiagnostics, the Norway maple has leaf buds that are deep red in colour and only have one terminal bud and Sycamore has\ngreen leaf buds and only has a single terminal bud."}
