In Greek, hetero means ‘different’\n  and _phylla_ means leaf.\n\nThe tree acquired the common name ‘hemlock’ from the parsley like smell of hemlock which the foliage gives off when\n  crushed (True hemlock is a herb in the carrot family __Apiacaeae__)\n\nA very fast growing tree used in timber production in the British Isles. Tsuga heterophylla is ecologically associated\n  with the temperate rain forests of the Pacific Fog bank and is therefore ideal for the wetter climate found in the west\n  of the British Isles.  Western Hemlock does not tolerate drought or exposure and can grow into a weak, multi-stemmed form\n  if environmentally stressed.\n\nThe light reddish brown timber is used for plywood, framing timber and other construction purposes. Untreated timber\n  is prone to decay and insect attack.\n\n_Tsuga heterophylla_ has a IUCN conservation rating ‘Least Concern’"}
