The two\ninnermost gate-piers are topped with decorative\nwrought iron lamp brackets. The gates and pillars were\nmoved back nearer to the lodges from their original\nposition in the 1 920's when the new Queen Margaret\nDrive and Bridge were constructed.\n\nThe Lodges of mock Tudor style flank the main\nentrance to the Gardens. Both are single storey with\nsymmetrical inward facing elevations and face onto\nGreat Western Road. The steps to the door have an\nashlar parapet supporting a gabled porch on Roman\nDoric columns. The porches are flanked by mullioned\nand transomed 3-light window and roll-moulded\npanels on the West lodge containing the Glasgow City\ncrest while the East lodge has the date 1894."}
