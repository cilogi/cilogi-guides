These are an important food source\n  for wildlife including deer and turkeys. The trees are mature at 20 years old and the seed are primarily spread\n  locally by squirrels and over a longer distance by blue jays.\n\n‘Velutina’ refers to the velvety or hairy covering on the young buds and leaves.\n\nNative Americans used black oak to treat a wide variety of ailments including indigestion, chills and fevers.\n\nThe hard, coarse grained timber is used in construction and fencing but due to numerous defects it is not as\n  popular as other oaks for furniture or cabinet making.\n\nThe area in front of you was called Kirklee Triangle. However, it has been re-named ‘The North American Hillside’.\nDuring recent storms, many of the mature trees in this area were blown over giving us the opportunity to replant\nit with a geographical theme. North America is very important to Glasgow Botanic Gardens due to our association with\nthe famous Scottish plant collector David Douglas.   He collected many rare and fascinating trees and plants from\nNorth America. As you stand and look up the hill, you will see a wide variety of tree species. At the base are trees\nthat grow at sea level and as you climb up the hill the altitude gets higher until you reach the conifers which can\nbe found at the highest point on a mountain, known as the tree line."}
