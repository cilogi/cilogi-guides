The felled logs are also used as ‘bed logs’ for shiitake mushroom (Cortinellus shiitake) cultivation.\n\nThe Japanese Alder is often planted to prevent erosion due to its lateral root system binding top soils together and\n  as its roots also fix nitrogen it can improve the quality of degraded land.\n\nThe bark of the tree is a popular folk medicine for treatment against cancer and hepatitis.\n\nIt is often found as a shade tree in coffee plantations\n\nThe tree in front of you was planted in 1982 and came into the Botanic Gardens as seed from Osaka University in Japan.\nWhen this plant entered the Gardens as seed it was given an accession number 001-090-82 this number stays with the plant\nfor its existence, all of its information is held on a plant data base system called BG-BASE.  As a botanic garden,\nrecord keeping is a fundamental part of our remit and in the future we would like to be able to produce hard copy\ncatalogues and online versions of the vast, varied, rare and unusual plants we hold in our collections for future\ngenerations of visiting public, researchers and horticulturists."}
