It is the most widely distributed pine species in North America.\n\nIt grows in various erect forms from British Columbia southward and eastward through 16 western U.S.\nstates and has been successfully introduced in temperate regions of Europe. It was first seen and\ncollected in 1826 in eastern Washington near present-day Spokane. On that occasion, David Douglas\nmisidentified it as Pinus resinosa (red pine). In 1829, Douglas concluded that he had a new pine\namong his specimens and coined the name Pinus ponderosa for its heavy wood. In 1836, it was formally\nnamed and described by Charles Lawson, a Scottish nurseryman. It is the official state tree\nof Montana."}
