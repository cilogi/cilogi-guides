Known as ‘Plant\nHunters’, these colourful characters explored the\nfurthest corners of the world in search of plants and\ntrees. They were real-life adventurers who returned\nwith intrepid tales, as well as precious and exotic plant\nseeds.\n\nThe most famous Scottish Plant Hunters included\n[Archibald Menzies](/wiki/Archibald_Menzies), [David Douglas](/wiki/David_Douglas),\n[Thomas Drummond](/wiki/Thomas_Drummond_&#40;botanist&#41;)\nand [John Jeffrey](/wiki/John_Jeffrey_&#40;botanist&#41;).\n\n[David Douglas](/wiki/David_Douglas), who is immortalised by the [Douglas\nFir tree](/wiki/Douglas_fir), collected more than 240 species. He is also\nfamous for introducing the [Sitka Spruce](../../13-sitka-spruce.html), which is now\nthe mainstay of the UK’s commercial forestry.

He worked in Glasgow Botanic Gardens\nin the early 1820s (he became the Head Gardener)\nand attended botany lectures. His exciting life ended\nin mysterious circumstances while collecting in Hawaii.\nThere is an area dedicated to David Douglas in the\nArboretum.\n\nPlant hunters still exist today. They are conservationists\nsearching for and trying to save threatened trees such\nas the [Moroccan Fir](../../18-moroccan-fir.html) and the [Arran Whitebeam](../../14-arran-whitebeam.html). You\ncan see both on the Trail."}
