It thrives in the Pacific Fog Belt near the coast from Alaska to California.\n\nThe tree is named after Sitka Island in Alaska.\n\nArchibald Menzies described the species as growing in North America in 1792 and the trees were introduced to\n Britain by David Douglas in 1831.\n\nA moisture loving tree it grows very well in Scotland and is a very important commercial timber tree. The speed of\n  growth of the Sitka Spruce means it can reach its maximum timber potential in 40 years in comparison to an oak which\n  may take over 150 years.\n\nIn plantation forestry, Sitka Spruce can grow very close together forming a dense canopy. This shades out other plant\n  species but many birds such as Goshawks and Sparrowhawks can hunt and nest around Sitka Spruce stands. Crossbills\n  and Siskin can also be found feeding and nesting in the branches.\n\nThe thinned timber from plantations is used to make pulp for paper making while more mature trees are turned into\n  pallets, packing boxes and used in construction\n\nMore information on the extensive uses of this tree for its timber can be found on the\n[Forestry Commissions Website](../../www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/INFD-5NLEJ6)"}
