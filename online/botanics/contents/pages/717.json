The larch grown on conifer plantations is a hybrid of the native and Japanese larch. Historically,\n  _Pinus sylvestris_ timber was imported from Europe under the name Riga Fir or Danzig Fir, named after the ports\n\nThe timber from _Pinus sylvestris_ known as ‘redwood’ or ‘red deal’ is easy to work and has a good strength to\n  weight ratio. The timber tolerates immersion in water so it was used in ship building, ship masts and water wheels.\n\nThe Scots pine is an important wildlife tree attracting Siskin, Great Spotted Woodpecker, Great Crested Tit and\n  Crossbill to feed in the branches.\n\nThe flat level branches make good predator perches and nesting sites for Osprey, Golden Eagles and goshawks\n\nThe Scots Pine arrived in Scotland after the last ice age around 7000 BC and was very successful until around 2000 BC.\nIn this period the climate of Scotland changed and it became wetter and winder and this also coincided with greater\nhuman activity both of which elements resulted in the decline of the Caledonian Forest across Scotland. One of the\nbest examples to see a remnant of the great Caledonian Forests that once covered Scotland is Glenn Affric in the\nHighlands.Often described as the most beautiful glen in Scotland; it contains one of the largest ancient Caledonian\npinewoods in Scotland as well as lochs, moorland and mountains."}
