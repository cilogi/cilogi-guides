He was a French naturalist\n  who was sent from the main French botanic garden, Jardin Des Plantes, to gather specimens inIndia. He died, aged 31,\n  in Bombay(Mumbai) from cholera.\n\nThe species name ‘utilis’ refers to the Latin word meaning ‘useful’. The local people exploit the tree for many\n  different uses:\n\nThe bark is used as a form of paper, often for sacred texts; the wood is used in making agricultural tools,\n  household utensils and fencing and the branches are often the only fuel wood available.\n\n_Betula utilis_ ssp. jacquemontii grows with rhododendron and juniper in its native range and is threatened due to\n  increased demand for firewood and overgrazing that is reducing regeneration."}
