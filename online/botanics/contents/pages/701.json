It is sometimes\nused to produce turpentine.\n\nThere is a pine collection in the arboretum with lots of interesting specimens including\n[_Pinus coulteri_](../../coulter-pine.html)\nnative to California and [_Pinus ponderosa_](../../ponderosa-pine.html) (Western Yellow Pine) collected by\nDavid Douglas in 1826 in eastern Washington State."}
