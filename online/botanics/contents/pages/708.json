The tree was introduced to the British Isles in 1948.\n\nThe original seed tree was part of a village shrine and was known locally as the Shui-su or water fir.\n\nOther _Metasequoia_ species appear in the fossil record and the extinct species appear to have made up a major portion\n  of tertiary fossil plant material. The Tertiary Period marks the beginning of the Cenozoic Era.\n  It began 65 million years ago and lasted more than 63 million years, until 1.8 million years ago.\n\n_Metasequoia glyptostroboides_ has a deciduous life cycle that allowed it to dominate the Northern Hemisphere until\n  temperatures became too low to support major forest cover.\n\nIt is a close relation of the giant Sequoias which is shown in the use of ‘meta’, meaning ‘near’.\n\nThe tree has an IUCN rating of endangered due to lack of habitat protection and fragmented populations.\n\nOther specimens can be viewed at the Kirklee entrance to the Gardens and in the arboretum. A number of trees of\n_Metasequoia_ can also be seen to the west of Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum near Kelvingrove Park."}
