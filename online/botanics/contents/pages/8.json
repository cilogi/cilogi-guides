An unusual and\nattractive station, it had the platforms and waiting rooms\nunderground as the railway ran mostly underground\nfrom Stobcross Junction (now the Exhibition Centre)\nup the valley of the River Kelvin to Maryhill.\n\n\nThe booking office was in a red brick building with a\nsteeply pitched roof having two towers with galleries,\nsurmounted by gilded onion domes. The centre portion\nof the frontage was a veranda and there were pavilions\nat either end. Botanic Gardens Station was the first to be\nclosed on 6th February 1939. The entire line was finally\nclosed down on the 5th October 1964 after just 68\nyears.\n\nThe booking office remained on Great Western Road\nlong after the station was closed and briefly became a\nnightclub called Sergeant Peppers from 1967 until it\nwas destroyed by fire in 1970.\n\nHere is a recent video of the interior of the station.\n\n<iframe width=\"300\" height=\"170\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/dCJnCuT8u00\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>"}
