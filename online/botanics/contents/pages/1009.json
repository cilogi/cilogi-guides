'Cowardly Lion' is a hybrid. It's a Kit Jeans Mounger cross, B. carrieae x B. _Bokit_.\nOther crosses have been made, using Cowardly Lion as a parent.\n\nThe coloration of the leaves reminds you of the Cowardly Lion's fur in the Wizard of Oz.\nIt's a medium-sized rhizomatous begonia which is suitable for houseplant growth, as it doesn't grow too large."}
