It grows in mountain valleys at altitudes of 1800–4300 m (rarely as low as 1200 m),\nbetween 30 m and 50 m in height. It favours a temperate climate with dry winters and wet summers.\n\nThe wood is moderately hard, durable and highly resinous. It is a good firewood but gives off a\npungent resinous smoke. It is a commercial source of turpentine which is superior quality than\nthat of P. roxburghii but is not produced so freely.\n\nIt is also a popular tree for planting in parks and large gardens, grown for its attractive foliage\nand large, decorative cones. It is also valued for its relatively high resistance to air pollution,\ntolerating this better than some other conifers.\n\nThis tree is often known as Bhutan pine, (not to be confused with the recently described Bhutan\nwhite pine, Pinus bhutanica, a closely related species). Other names include blue pine,[2]\nHimalayan pine and Himalayan white pine. In the past, it was also known by the invalid botanic\nnames Pinus griffithii McClelland or \"Pinus excelsa\" Wall., Pinus chylla Lodd. when the tree became\navailable through the European nursery trade in 1836, nine years after Nathaniel Wallich first\nintroduced seeds to England.\n\nThe leaves (\"needles\") are in fascicles (bundles) of five and are 12–18 cm long. They are noted\nfor being flexible along their length, and often droop gracefully. The cones are long and slender,\n16–32 cm, yellow-buff when mature, with thin scales; the seeds are 5–6 mm long with a 20–30 mm wing.\n\nTypical habitats are mountain screes and glacier forelands, but it will also form old-growth\nforests as the primary species or in mixed forests with deodar, birch, spruce, and fir.\nIn some places it reaches the tree line."}
