He is said to have pocketed some Monkey Puzzle nuts from the dinner table\nwhen his ships crew dined as guests of the governor of Chile. The seeds grew into five health saplings that were\neventually returned to Britain.\n\nThe tree derives its name from the Araucano indigenous people of Chile. They had traditionally used the tree seed\nas an important seasonal food.\n\nThere are no monkeys in the native range of the tree.\n\nThe environment that the tree survives in is very dynamic and the effects of volcanoes, fire, landslides, snow\navalanche and high wind have led to some unusual adaptations. Unlike most conifers _Araucaria_ spp. can sprout from\ncut stumps (epicormic buds)  or underground roots after being felled and it has very thick bark.\n\nThe tree is threatened by land use change, mining and quarrying and over exploitation as a cheap source of timber.\n\nIt is incredibly long lived tree with specimens over 1300 years old not uncommon.\n\nThe tree has an IUCN rating of ‘Endangered’"}
