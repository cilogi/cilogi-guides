Having been planted in 1818 it was then moved to its current site in 1841.\n\nAsh wood is very strong and flexible.  Tests show ash to have “greater toughness (impact strength)\n  than any other home-grown hardwood.\n\nThe timber is a white wood that was used historically in the making of tool handles and coach building.\n\nThe foliage made good fodder for livestock.\n\nAsh populations are now threatened by a fungal disease, ash dieback (Chalara fraxinea).\n  This kills young trees very quickly but can take some time to destroy mature trees.\n  In Europe, affected countries have lost 60-90% of their ash trees.\n\nThe tree does not have an IUCN rating.\n\nAsh trees have very distinctive diagnostic features which help to identify the tree even when leafless.\nThese include, hard black buds, grey smooth bark with some vertical, shallow fissures and twigs\nthat become flattened around the buds."}
