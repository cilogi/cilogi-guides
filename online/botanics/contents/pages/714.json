A unique clonal population (microspecies) then grew from the seeds of the hybrid.\nThis happens through a form of asexual (non-sexual) reproduction (agamospermy).\n\nThe species has been at the centre of conservation work along with another species the Arran Service Tree:\n_Sorbus pseudofennica_. In 1954 a National Nature Reserve was set up to protect and manage the habitats growing around\nthe trees and in 1984 a trial population reinforcement programme was implemented. Work is still continuing on the\nspecies at Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh as part of the Target 8 Project. The Target 8 Project is one of the targets\nset out in the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation, which aims to conserve 75% of threatened native species in\ncultivation. _Sorbus arranensis_ is one of theses threatened species due to habitat loss, severe weather and over grazing\nby sheep and cattle. There is thought to be only around 500 plants left growing in the north of the Isle of Arran."}
