Isolated groves are found\nas far north as the San Francisco Bay Area in Mt. Diablo State Park and Black Diamond Mines\nRegional Preserve. The species is named after Thomas Coulter, an Irish botanist and physician.\n\nThe Coulter pine produces the largest cone of any pine tree. Although it has a limited range\nin the wild, it is a popular ornamental tree.\n\nThe wood is weak and soft, so that the species is little used other than for firewood."}
