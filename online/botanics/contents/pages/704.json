The oily flesh of the seed from female trees produces an unpleasant odour.\n\nThe tree has an IUCN Red List rating of ‘Endangered’.\n\nFew, if any, Ginkgo’s survive in the wild but they are cultivated around the world.\nThe leaves and seeds have been used in traditional Chinese medicine since the 11th century.\n\nBoth the Ginkgo’s defence mechanisms and its high life expectancy are due to five substances which are only found in\nGinkgo’s: ginkgolides.  These were discovered by Japanese researchers in 1932.\nGinkgolides enhance circulation and also improve the elasticity of blood vessels.\nConsequently, ‘Ginkgo’ is used widely today in preventing and managing memory loss and circulatory disorders in the elderly.\nIt has become well-known for treating sufferers of Alzheimers disease."}
