It was well established as a\ngrain mill in 1765 and was also used to grind\ngunpowder during the Napoleonic wars. The mill was\nconverted, to grind flints by the owner of the [Verreville\nPottery][1] in Glasgow, in the middle of the nineteenth\ncentury. The flints were first calcined (burnt) in the kiln\non the same site. Verreville Pottery closed in 1917 but a\nfirm from Paisley kept the North Woodside Mill working.\nThe mill continued to operate until the late 1950's and\nsoon after closure the buildings were partially\ndemolished.\n\nThe most substantial survivals are the square tapering\nkiln of stone and brick. concrete, and the weir and lade.\n\n[1]: /wiki/Verreville_Glass_and_Pottery_Works,_Glasgow"}
