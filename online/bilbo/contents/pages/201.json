Originally\nowned by John Kibble, an engineer with wide interests\nand some eccentricities, his private conservatory was\nmoved to its present site in 1873. The main\nconservatory: 150ft (46m) in diameter, is spanned by a\nsaucer-shaped dome with cupola.\n\n\nThe Kibble Place was closed in 2003 in advance of a\nmultimillion pound restoration. This was completed in\n2006 and the glasshouse re-opened to the public on St\nAndrews day that year"}
