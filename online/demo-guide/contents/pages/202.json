It does have some special features though, some of\nwhich may not be obvious.\n\n* If you bookmark the guide you can access it even when you're\n  offline inside a building or outside 3G or WiFi range.\n* Whenever you see a grid icon with a number, if you hit the `Keypad`\n  menu item at the top of the screen and type the number into the\n  keypad you will be taken to information about the item associated\n  with that number.\n* You can tap most images to get a larger view, which you can pan by\n  touching and moving, and scale by pinch zoom (where available).\n* Some items are part of tours.

See\n    [the Botanics trail](../../tours/botanics-trail.html) for an example tour.\n* _Map_. Some items, which have a physical location, can be viewed on a\n    map. A guide can have several maps, but each map item occurs on\n    only one map.  If you touch the map button the item's map will be\n    shown, with the item in solid blue.  Other items will be\n    semi-transparent.
